There was a <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/archives/2007/01/putting_your_in.php">post over at Panlibus about find it in Talis links being added to Google Scholar</a>. I have links to WorldCat and MSU so had presumed it was a IP thing. I had forgotten that I had set it up in my preferences. A <a href="http://librariancentral.blogspot.com/2007/02/out-of-cite.html">post over on the Google Librarian blog pointed out the citation export feature</a>.

Well I went ahead and added Talis to try it out and it indeed worked even for someone across the pond. I'm back to WorldCat and my local library since it helps with work but I like having options. Now just to get the consortia on board.

I think it would be cool if they added various citation formats like ALA, Chicago, etc though I guess getting them into the major programs is a first start. Once they allow me to star items and build lists, I'll be set.
