If you haven't already caught it, <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html">Outlook 2007 changes html support rather drastically</a>. In fact it appears to go backwards from the last version of Outlook. The change is from the IE rendering engine to the Word html rendering engine. Some are guessing this is related to anti-trust.

Regardless if your library sends out newsletters that are html emails then you may want to test it with the latest outlook to make sure it's readable.
