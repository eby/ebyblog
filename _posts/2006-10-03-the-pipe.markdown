For my lounge time I've taken up the pipe to go with my homebrew and liqour. A bit easier on the senses then a cigar. I'm lucky enough to have a quality pipe shop near by that does some nice local tobacco blends. I only have a few pipes but it is a lifestyle in itself.

<h4>Death of the White Goddess</h4>

The Nonist has a nice post about Meerschaum Pipes, titled <a href="http://thenonist.com/index.php/thenonist/permalink/the_meerschaum_pipe/">The death of the White Goddess</a>

<blockquote>Admittedly pipe smoking has long since passed its peak of popularity. The days of gentlemen sitting in their book-lined studies puffing at a fine pipe whilst sipping at a tumbler of brandy are long gone, thrown out with the servants, the wife-ruling, the mistresses, and the dishwater.</blockquote>

<h4>The Chap Revolution</h4>

I recently ILL'd a book called "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chap-Manifesto-Revolutionary-Etiquette-Gentleman/dp/1841156574/">The Chap Manifesto</a>" which is quite humorous. I've since found that there is an <a href="http://thechap.net/latestissue.html">entire satire magazine</a> based on the concept. They even held a <a href="http://www.thechap.net/olympics.html">chap olympics</a>. The BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/magazine_the_chap_olympics/html/1.stm">some photos as well</a>.

<blockquote>Society is withering, like the fruit on some diseased vine. We have become the playthings of corporations intent on converting our world into a gargantuan shopping precinct. Pleasantness and civility are being discarded as the worthless ephemera of a bygone age - an age when men doffed their hats at the ladies, and small children could be counted upon to mind one's Jack Russell while one took a mild and bitter in the local hostelry.</blockquote>

Join the revolution!
