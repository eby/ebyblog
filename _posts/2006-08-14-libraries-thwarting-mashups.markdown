If <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/libraries-thwarting-open-access/">thwarting open-access wasn't enough</a>, it seems that access to electronic form of classification systems is quite prohibitory. <a href="http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2006/08/angry-about-classification.php">Tim writes over at the LibraryThing blog about his research into classification systems</a>, and why he'll likely have to go with little known classifications to do what he wants. I personally found it rather surprising that such data was that hard to get. I can see the charging for value-added services such as customized clients and workflows but keeping the data itself behind walls was a bit more than i expected.

There's some talk in the comments on whether LC can prevent others from providing the data since it's governmental and should be open. Regardless the post and the comments are worth a read.
