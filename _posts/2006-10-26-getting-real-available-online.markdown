The PDF "book" Getting Real that I've quoted here quite a bit is <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php">now available online in HTML form for free</a>. You can still purchase the PDF or printed copy (lulu publishing).  I recommend giving it a read if you haven't already.

<blockquote>Getting real is less. Less mass, less software, less features, less paperwork, less of everything that's not essential (and most of what you think is essential actually isn't).</blockquote>
