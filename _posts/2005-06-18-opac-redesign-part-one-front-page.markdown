<p>My problems with my <a href="http://magic.msu.edu/">library's OPAC</a> are numerous. Some are likely fixable, some probably aren't due to the software or cataloging practices. I find that making a laundry list tends to be a bad thing for me as once I see some things in action I have second thoughts. I've decided to do create some mock-ups of the various areas of the OPAC and how things might be. These aren't complete redesigns as I don't trust the software to be that customizable. Instead I've tried to modify the current design in ways I think might make it more usable. By usable, I mean what seems that way to me. Obviously I haven't done any usability studies on these designs. So first lets look at the current design:</p>

<p><a href="http://magic.msu.edu/">Current OPAC Site</a></p>
<p>The first thing that bothers me is that there is no search box on the front page. I see no reason that I have to choose the type of search and then load a seperate page for each one. The search results allow you to change search type so there is no reason not to have it on the front page. Advanced search could be linked to from here.</p>

<p>Second is our link list. The link text seems to be very similar and can make it hard to see what exactly is offered. It would be nice to have the links seperated more and perhaps categorized to make it easier to see what services are offered relating to the OPAC. For example, I had no idea that I could search course reserves until I started giving the page a close inspection. Some of the links are scopes as well which could be included right into the basic search box. Also, there is no link to our ILL department which causes me to get many calls from patrons asking how to request a book we don't have. This link would also be good on search result pages.</p>

<p>Third is the button for MelCat. I've known MelCat as a "meta-catalog" of Michigan Libraries. I had no idea that you could request books through it. I also had no idea that the library prefered people request through MelCat before doing an ILL request. Having buttons to partners and services is really not that great of an idea unless it also gives an idea of the purpose of it being there. The current graphic gives nothing and could almost be mistaken for an ad or partner link and not the great service it actually is.</p>

<p>Another thing that struck me is that the library catalog is often a standalone site. I know quite a few people that do not visit the library site but instead just stick to the catalog. With the space left over from getting rid of all the search types, I thought it would be good to highlight related library services. This could be a dynamic rotating list of things such as Reference, Search Tips, ILL services, Circulation info, etc. If your library has a reference weblog or similar, it could even be syndicated to the OPAC front page. The possibilities are fairly open.</p>

<p>So I threw together a quick mock-up to show some of the things I'm talking about. None of the links really work and the page is static right now. I also updated the header to match the current library website design. This is a quick hackjob so if it breaks in your browser I apologize. The image below is what it should look like.</p>

<p>Feel free to leave comments on what you think and your opinions of what would make a better catalog homepage. Next up is the search results.</p>
