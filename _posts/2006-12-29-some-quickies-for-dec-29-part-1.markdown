These have been sitting around for too long so here they are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://scilib.typepad.com/science_library_pad/2006/12/in_which_the_op.html">Over at Science Library Pad</a> there is a post about SOA and the need to analyze business cases. I don't fully agree with the option of depending on general search engines but providing better outputs and formats (api's, microformats, etc), I definitely agree with. I may do a presentation on microformats with edsu at code4lib if the site ever lets me register.</li>
<li>Some classes are starting to <a href="http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=114689&ran=20962">write their own text-book</a> available as OA. I won't hold my breath but every little bit against the pigopolists helps.</li>
<li>Laura has <a href="http://liblogs.albany.edu/library20/2006/10/the_ideal_20_scholarly_portal.html">some ideas about an ideal scholarly portal</a>. I agree with most except for some like linking to social sites. Of course it depends on the audience. I'd add on microformats, etc.</li>
<li>I've already posted about it but I'll link to it again as I think many don't get it. Alan Gray has a post <a href="http://www.darienlibrary.org/staffpages/gray/blog/archives/2006/08/siege_warfare.html">Siege Warfare</a> that talks about making the reference more approachable. I think it's really important to make services more usable and approachable. They seem to do the opposite here.</li>
<li>Here's a <a href="http://davidseah.com/static/cal/ccal2007.htm">compact calendar</a> which is quite nice a printable.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/projects/melvyl_recommender/">final report for the Melvyl Recommender project</a></li>
<li>Notes from a <a href="http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/index.php/2006/10/25/il2006-day-2-delivering-individualized-library-content-portals-and-the-future-of-library-web-sites/">session on library portals and individualized content</li>
<li>A post over at panlibus <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/archives/2006/10/is_there_a_plac.php">about p2p and libraries</a>. Some ideas about aggregated data and the like</li>
<li>Presentations from Open Education 2006 are available in a <a href="http://cosl.usu.edu/conferences/opened2006/docs/opened2006-proceedings.pdf">single whopping PDF</a></li>
<li>If your looking for some data to play with, the SEC <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/XBRL-RSS">offers some structured feeds. Could be helpful with those doing business reference type things.</li>
</ul>
