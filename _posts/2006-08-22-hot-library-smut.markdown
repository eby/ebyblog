Came across an <a href="http://thenonist.com/index.php/thenonist/permalink/hot_library_smut/">post with the name Hot Library Smut and just had to click</a>. It's about a photography book of libraries around the world. The post includes some pictures from the book and it does look great. Definitely worth a look.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com:80/gp/product/0500543143/">Amazon Page</a> - has title and author wrong</li>
<li><a href="http://worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org&q=0500543143">OpenWorldCat</a> - which also seems to have an iffy title</li>
</ul>
