Or at least the possibility of some in library-land. I've thrown around the idea back when code4lib'ers were discussing the possibility of a non-profit status for the group, that it might be worthwhile to build some web services/APIs for various things libraries could use such as records, relationships, artwork, etc. Nothing came of it but it looks like I don't have to bother with the records anymore. I missed it in the initial release but <a href="http://www.bookism.org/open/2006/12/04/casey-bisson-named-one-of-first-winners-of-mellon-award-for-technology-collaboration/">from a Open Libraries post</a>:

<blockquote>The revolutionary part of the announcement, however, was that Plymouth State University would use the $50,000 to purchase Library of Congress catalog records and redistribute them free under a Creative Commons Share-Alike license or GNU.</blockquote>

I have high hopes that it will be published in some sort of downloadable format so people can do experiments or build value-added services on top of it. <a href="http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2006/12/bisson-and-open-datalet-revolution.php">Tim is definitely happy</a>. Some of the things I'd like to see:

<ul>
<li>Torrents of the data, available in chunks if needed</li>
<li>Web service with access by keyword, isbn, subject and other fields</li>
<li>Wiki-version where people can augment or fix the record data. Hopefully an API on top of this as well. WikiD maybe?</li>
<li>Maybe other data formats/conversions.</li>
</ul>

Here's hoping.
