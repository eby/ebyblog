<p>Got a call from <a href="http://www.maisonbisson.com/blog/">Casey</a> today and while discussing the <a href="http://libdev.plymouth.edu">libdev site</a> he mentioned he used <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a>. I used some desktop apps in the previous life of my blog and though they were nice I found myself working inside the browser more often or not. Since he mentioned it though I thought I'd take another look. I have to say it has come quite a ways since I used it last and am giving it a second chance. Especially nice are the various macros and the ease of tagging posts. Pretty much everything is customizable. I recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Currently listening to: <strong>Friends Of P.</strong> from the album "Return Of The Rentals" by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The Rentals%22">The Rentals</a></p>
