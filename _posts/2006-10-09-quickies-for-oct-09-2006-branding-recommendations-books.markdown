Here's some stuff I probably could post more about:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kalsey.com/2006/10/small_screen_branding/">Branding for the small screen</a> - many companies are changing their branding to work at small resolutions. Something for libraries to keep in mind as people start using the pda, phone and other devices to browse the catalog. Think about where your logo will be shown when designing it and not just letterhead. Ours does not scale well.</li>
<li>Some publishers are already seeing increased sales from <a href="http://today.reuters.com/misc/PrinterFriendlyPopup.aspx?type=technologyNews&storyID=2006-10-06T125540Z_01_L06708070_RTRUKOC_0_US-MEDIA-GOOGLE-BOOKS.xml">google book search</a>. Others find more from Amazon which seems likely since it's the point of sale.</li>
<li><a href="http://education.zdnet.com/?p=566">Students fight for their IP rights.</a> - Some students are fighting the use of services like TurnItIn that detect plagiarism but also keep a digital copy of the work. Nice to see.</li>
<li>Audio and presentations from <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/lis/stndrds/grps/acoc/papers2006.html">Beyond the OPAC : future directions for Web-based catalogues</a> are available online now.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://live.poptech.org/">Pop!Tech conference will be available live online</a> for free. They are even allowing questions and comments during presentations from the web. Will be interesting to see how this pans out.</li>
<li>Stephen is compiling a <a href="http://stephenslighthouse.sirsidynix.com/archives/2006/09/book_recommenda_1.html">list of book recommendation engines</a>. May be useful.</li>
</ul>
