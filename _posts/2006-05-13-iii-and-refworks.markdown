I <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/passing-bib-numbers-from-the-iii-opac/">posted here previously</a> about passing the bib number out of the iii opac and mentioned citation formatters as a possible use. <a href="http://foam.lib.muohio.edu/blog/?p=8">Rob Casson has taken this idea and used it to pass information on to refworks</a>. He's passing the marc record instead of using the xml server but the concept is the same and it makes sense since he's not doing it all in house. Take a look.

This is just one example of what benefits access to data can bring. It would be much nicer if the url structure for iii was nicer for things like marc, etc.
