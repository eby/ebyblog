Nature's blog <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2006/04/open_text_mining_interface_1.html">Nascent has a post</a> on the availability of Atom feeds for their content. The feeds (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7083/otmi/otmi-nature04614.xml">example</a>) also have a prism and the custom otmi namespace for additional content/metadata.

I wouldn't bother noting it but I find the otmi namespace interesting. Nature, not being OA, I presume doesn't want to give the full text of their articles in an easy to access open format. There are still requests for information for data mining projects, apparently. The format provides keywords and their number of occurrences as well as snippets that are out of order for some context. I still lean towards OA but I see this being a helpful addition for those building indexes and meta-search initiatives in the mean-time.
