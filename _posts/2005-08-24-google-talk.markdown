Great to see a client that uses<a href="http://jabber.org">Jabber</a> being pushed. Finally I get to use a server where I might actually remember my password. I'm slowly moving away from AIM/MSN and the other closed protocols. I might move my jabber contacts over to the google server. Not sure who they use for voice. I'm still going to use Skype for now. I'm using <a href="http://gaim.sf.net">Gaim</a> and <a href="http://adiumx.com">Adium</a> as my IM clients though.
