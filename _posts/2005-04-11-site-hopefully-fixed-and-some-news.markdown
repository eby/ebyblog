<p>First, I moved my server and went ahead and upgraded some of the software on it. It the process some things broke. This is what happens when I do everything myself. Hopefully everything is fixed. If you see any craziness, please let me know.</p>
<p>On a side note, I've been officially hired by the MSU Libraries which should hopefully afford me the luxury of working on projects related to the ones you've seen. More frequent posts coming soon.</p>
