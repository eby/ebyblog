John Udell <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/16/a-message-for-library-catalog-vendors/">has a few requests for catalog vendors</a>, including making it easier to search by ISBN and for related ISBN's. <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/16/a-message-for-library-catalog-vendors/#comment-40318">Peter Murray commented</a> that the url should probably be a bit more restful and mentioned PatREST. Talis <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/panlibus/archives/2007/07/a_message_to_li.php">responded that it would be quite simple</a> except for the xISBN which could cost a lot with large number of searches.

Everything sounds like decent suggestions though I'd like to see many more REST interfaces built into the ILS.
