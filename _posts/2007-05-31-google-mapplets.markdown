Google has a <a href="http://maps.google.com/preview">preview</a> available of their mapplets along with <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/index.html">some documentation</a>. Here's a screenshot of the weatherbug mapplet:

With the custom markers and search form available it may be interesting to throw together a mapplet for worldcat or a local consortia, plotting the libraries that carry the item and possibly status if available. You could probably do color coded markers to give a quick glance of status. Maybe someone with more time than me will mock something up.
