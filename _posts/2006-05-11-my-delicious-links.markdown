As you may have noticed by the link posts on the blog, I've moved back to del.icio.us for my links. I've disabled the automatic posting as I'm moving links over to it and don't want to spam anyone. I'm not certain if I will start having it post again. If you've found any of the links useful then feel free to go over to <a href="http://del.icio.us/eby">my del.icio.us page</a> and subscribe to that feed.
