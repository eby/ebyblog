I'm a photography fan, especially some of the found photo projects I see. Here's another project where they gave migrants and minutemen disposable cameras with prepaid returns to show what it means to be on their side. Some striking photos.

<blockquote>We distributed cameras to migrants primarily at shelters and through humanitarian organizations on the Mexican side of the border.  Most migrants had never seen or used disposable cameras before.  We gave them a brief tutorial and then asked them to photograph their journeys into the United States.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Minuteman Civil Defense Corps is comprised of American citizens who are trying to do what they believe the government should: secure the border. They set up observation posts on the U.S. side and search for anyone crossing illegally. We sent cameras to camps in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas and asked volunteers to capture what it means to be a Minuteman.</blockquote>
