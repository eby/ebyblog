Came across a post over at Business Logs (great blog) called <a href="http://businesslogs.com/design_and_usability/the_user_experience_bar_is_now_sky_high.php">The User Experience Bar Is Now Sky High</a> which showed off some of the upcoming interfaces to some web apps. Definitely some interesting things being done and it will be interesting to see how many of these become common place. The one that stood out though was definitely Scrybe and I recommend watching the video to see what I mean:
