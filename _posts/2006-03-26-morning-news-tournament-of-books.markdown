The Morning News has begun their <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/tob/matches.php">Tournament of Books</a>. A new match is posted every weekday until it's finished. The reviews are pretty good though the commentary can be great. I found <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/tob/match2-kg.php">this one</a> quite humorous:

<blockquote>People who reread novels are buying only half as many books as their monoreading counterparts. At a time when the overall consumption of literary fiction is bottoming out like Paul PrudhommeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mardi Gras float, we simply must have zero tolerance for people who reread books theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already digested. Rereading MidnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Children, for instance, is no different from breaking into Salman RushdieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luxurious Manhattan apartment and stealing a wheel of imported cheese.</blockquote>
