Just came across the <a href="http://www.listeningtowords.com/index.php">listeningtowords site</a> which is collecting information on the lectures available on the web in audio or video. There's a lot of great content online, especially with more and more universities and colleges adding their lectures to iTunes and the like. It's nice to see sites like this that may make them easier to locate.

The site includes the now normal things like tagging, comments, playlist, favorites, etc. It has a very del.icio.us feel to it. You can't add lectures directly it appears but you can suggest things to be added. I presume as a sort of quality control for the time being.
