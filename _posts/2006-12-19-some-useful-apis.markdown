LinuxWorld has an article on <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2006/121806-web-20-apis.html?page=1">10 Web API's you can really use</a>. Some of the normal ones like Amazon and Google Maps are in there but it was nice to see things like the ATOM protocol highlighted. Here's a few that also seemed useful:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/API">MediaWiki API</a> - An in-progress API to all the wikimedia stuff and those who use the software. Looks like it will offer quite a few outputs and could really help with integration with things like WPOpac and the like.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/">Geonames API</a> - Allows conversion of place names to zip codes, lon/lan, etc. Could be quite useful for some of those doing text analysis.</li>
<li><a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> - one of the many identity options coming out</li>
<li><a href="http://js-kit.com/">JS-Kit</a> - add comments to any page that you can put javascript in. Some libraries may find it helpful. You'll have to think about the privacy and longevity of the project though.</li>
</ul>
