The <a href="http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/?page_id=5">tentative schedule for Access 2006</a> has been posted. Lots of names I recognize and has a tint of code4lib to it. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to attend. I haven't been to Canada in some time and never much outside of toronto and some stuff at the border. I'll have to remember to get a passport this time though.
