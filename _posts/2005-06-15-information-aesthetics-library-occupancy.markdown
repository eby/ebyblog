An interesting article in New Library World that maps patron use of study areas using GIS mapping. Conclusions are as I would expect: 
"The findings of this research challenge the predominant opinion that insists that academic library users have a preference of study carrels over tables for studying. Instead, the research reveals that student users tend to select tables to study, especially tables equipped with electrical and internet connections."
