It's probably a little too early here to even start some of the transplants but for those who like to garden, you might be interested in the <a href="http://www.victorygardendrive.blogspot.com/">Victory Garden Drive</a>.

<blockquote>Pattie Baker, publisher of FoodShed Planet (www.foodshedplanet.com) announces the FoodShed Planet Victory Garden Drive, with a goal of inspiring the creation of two million new organic gardens worldwide in 2008. Backyard gardens, windowsill gardens, community gardens, school gardens. They all count.</blockquote>

The gist is to get some friends and/or neighbors that haven't to start at least a small garden this year. As for the term victory garden, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_garden">from wikipedia</a>:

<blockquote>Amid regular rationing of canned food in the United States, a poster campaign ("Plant more in '44!") encouraged the planting of Victory Gardens by nearly 20 million Americans. These gardens produced up to 40 percent of all the vegetable produce consumed nationally.

It was emphasised to home front urbanites and suburbanites that the produce from their gardens would help to lower the price of vegetables needed by the War Department to feed the troops, thus saving money that could be spent elsewhere on the military: "Our food is fighting", one poster read.</blockquote>

Since we're in a war, I guess now is as good as any time.
