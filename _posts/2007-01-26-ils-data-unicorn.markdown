Here's another <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/ils-data-series/">in the series</a>.

<h3><a href="http://www.sirsidynix.com/Solutions/Products/integratedsystems.php">Unicorn</a></h3>

<dl>
<dt>Export</dt>
<dd>Built in. MARC21 or flat file formats. Unicode support is available as an extra.</dd>
<dt>Database Access</dt>
<dd>Mixed. No access to the embedded Informix database by default; API training is necessary for read-only access. Oracle is an extra option, but that only gives you a read-only license. For write access, you need a full Oracle license. SQL schema is supplied if you purchase API training.</dd>
<dt>API's and Web Services</dt>
<dd>Mixed. Z39.50 is offered (not sure if it's an extra). "API access" is an extra - basically you pay for docs of Unix-like commands and the ability to pay for API support if you screw up. API training also gives you some access to the client/server wire protocol so you can roll your own. No Web services. Utterly unusable XML API (it basically wraps the wire protocol with no abstraction).</dd>
