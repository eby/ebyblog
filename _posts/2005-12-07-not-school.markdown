From the <a href="http://www.notschool.net/ns/template.php?id=about">Notschool.net about page</a>:

<blockquote>Notschool.net is an online research project looking at ways of re-engaging young people of school age back into learning. These young people have been out of the more traditional educational systems for a variety of personal and logistical reasons. They include the phobic, ill, disaffected, sick, pregnant and the excluded. Notschool.net is specifically aimed at those for whom traditional alternatives such as home tutoring have not worked.</blockquote>

As a former education major (still am officially) I did quite a bit of mentoring and tutoring, especially with troubled kids. It was often the opinion of educators around me that the kids did not want to learn but in my view it was often the learning environment that failed. It's good to see programs like this using technology and semi-structured learning environments to get kids back into learning. And the important word is learning, not school.

There's some reports and other information on the website. Those who work instruction or want to help create learning environments in their settings may find it useful.
