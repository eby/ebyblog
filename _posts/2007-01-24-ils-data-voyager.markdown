Again this info is from users/customers and not press releases so may be different for various versions:

<h3><a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/voyager.htm">Voyager</a></h3>

<dl>
<dt>Export</dt>
<dd>Built in. Can export Marc with bib, holdings and authorities records, though marc is often mangled.</dd>
<dt>Database Access</dt>
<dd>Built in. Uses Oracle and also provides entity-relationship diagrams and some pre-build "views" to help in development. I believe the oracle license is also included in the base price. Access is read-only.</dd>
<dt>API's and Web Services</dt>
<dd>Built in. z39 access, however with SQL access you could likely build the API you need.</dd>
</dl>
