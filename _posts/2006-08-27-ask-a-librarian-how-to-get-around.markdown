An interesting outreach mechanism for on campus. The ASU libraries set-up tents around campus with signs for anyone that was lost or had trouble finding the class. Also gave out bottled water. One way to show your presence on campus and a little more useful then the usual tent that asks you to sign up for a credit card to get a t-shirt (common here at state).
