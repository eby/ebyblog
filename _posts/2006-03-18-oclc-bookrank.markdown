Your probably already aware of the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/top1000/complete.htm">OCLC top holdings lists</a>. I was going to pass over <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/top_1000_books_in_libary_colle.html">a post at O'reilly on it</a> but came across this:

<blockquote>Lorcan also says that they are planning to offer a web service to look up the library holding rank for any title.</blockquote>

I can see this being used in OpenWorldCat or similar offerings to give a little rank number similar to Amazon's sales rank. It will be interesting to see how libraries use it in their sites/opacs.
