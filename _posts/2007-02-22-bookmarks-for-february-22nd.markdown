<li><a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/2007/02/from_youtube_to_youniversity.html">Confessions of an Aca/Fan: The Official Weblog of Henry Jenkins: From YouTube to YouNiversity</a> - </li>
<li><a href="http://okonet.ru/projects/modalbox/">ModalBox ? An easy way to create popups and wizards</a> - ModalBox is a JavaScript technique for creating modern (Web 2.0-style) modal dialogs or even wizards (sequences of dialogs) without using conventional popups and page reloads. It's inspired by Mac OS X modal dialogs.</li>
<li><a href="http://microformatique.com/?p=97">Semantics in HTML Part II - standardizing vocabularies at microformatique - a blog about microformats and ?data at the edges?</a> - In this part, we?ll look at other sources of semantics from outside HTML itself, including the mechanisms used to ?inject? these semantics.</li>
<li><a href="http://lawgeek.typepad.com/lawgeek/2007/02/riaa_stepping_u.html">LawGeek: RIAA stepping up college complaints about P2P; MSU forces recipients to watch RIAA propaganda</a> - Hall meets personally with students caught twice and forces them to watch an eight-minute anti-piracy DVD produced by the RIAA. A third-time offender can be suspended for a semester.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/billmccoy/2007/02/steve_jobs_elim.html">Bill McCoy: Steve Jobs: "Eliminate Music DRM!": So, What About eBooks?</a> - Yet, I would like nothing more than to have DRM technology just fade away. After all the main challenge we have in digital publishing is to get it adopted by mainstream consumers. And the main challenge 98% of book authors and publishers have is to get people to be aware of their books, not to prevent piracy. So my challenge to print publishers and authors: why not support &quot;social DRM&quot;, rather than heavyweight DRM? If that's a direction you are willing to go, Adobe will back you up, 1000%.</li>
