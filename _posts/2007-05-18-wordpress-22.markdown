Most users have probably already seen it but thought I might point out some of the changes that look really useful. I'm still a huge fan of Wordpress.

<ul>
<li>You can now set your site's "home" and "siteurl" values in the wp-config.php file. Meaning you can copy the DB easily between a test and live instance without changing the options in the database. This is probably the biggest useful feature for me.</li>
<li>Full Atom 1.0 support including Atom feeds and the Atom API</li>
<li>Plugin Sandbox - should prevent the dreaded blank page when a plugin bombs</li>
<li>Better UTF-8 support</li>
</ul>

There is also the list of <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.2&resolution=fixed&order=id">245 closed problem tickets for the release if you want to see the bugs that were fixed</a>.
