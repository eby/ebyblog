<h4><a href="http://burningbird.net/technology/maps-n-data/">Maps n' Data</a></h4>

A nice post on geodata and the mass annotation of geo-spacial data. We're not making maps, we're annotating space. It then goes on to data formats and the need for more open data:

<blockquote>I'm going to get all Creative Commonsly on you and state that we focus so much on art, music, and creative writing when it comes to the 'be free' movement, when I think we should spend more time on data, specifically metadata. I'm a believer that any service that collects metadata from the public, should make such metadata freely available. I won't use a service that doesn't.</blockquote>

<h4><a href="http://sites.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/">How to Publish Linked Data on the Web</a></h4>

<blockquote>The term Linked Data was coined by Tim Berners-Lee in his Linked Data Web architecture note. The term refers to a set of best practices on how to publish and interlink structured data on the Web. The basic assumption behind Linked Data is that the value and usefulness of data increases the more it is interlinked with other data. In summary, Linked Data is simply about using the Web to create typed links between data from different sources.</blockquote>

<h4><a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2007/07/commentpress_10.html">CommentPress 1.0</a></h4>

I've been waiting for this since they first showed a demo. Has a lot of potential of open access publishing I think.

<blockquote>At long last, we are pleased to release CommentPress, a free, open source theme for the WordPress blog engine designed to allow paragraph-by-paragraph commenting in the margins of a text.</blockquote>

Your site needs to be useful even if only one person uses it.
