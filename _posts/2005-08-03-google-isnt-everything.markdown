<blockquote>My biggest complaint is that some libraries' Web sites don't detail the amazing range of services they offer online until you cough up a card number. Memo to those insular institutions: Put the info in the shop windows out front and I bet you'll see a lot more card-carrying customers walking through the electronic doors.</blockquote><a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0815/056_print.html">Forbes.com: Google isn't everything.</a> - via <a href="http://edwards.orcas.net/~misseli/blog/archives/000298.html">Confessions of a Mad Librarian</a> and others.
<p>This is one of those things I've been complaining about for awhile. I'm always told that libraries offer so many great services. But as a user I find that discovering these services isn't always easy. This is especially the case for ones that have the OPAC as a separate entity where users might not even visit the library homepage. I've written about this before in a <a href="http://ebybox.aresgate.net/blog/archives/opac-redesign-part-one-front-page/">previous post</a>. I think pushing services will be very important in the future.</p>
