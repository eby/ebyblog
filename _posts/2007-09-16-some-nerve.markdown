<blockquote>Guns, I am told, are dangerous. But women are dangerous, too.</blockquote>

I've always enjoyed reading <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/">K.G. Schneider's</a> writing (and presentations) and her <a href="http://www.nerve.com/personalessays/schneider/rangeofdesire/">essay for Nerve</a> is no different. If you haven't already given it a read you should. I've been an occasional reader of Nerve and they tend to have great writing so it's nice to see her featured there.

While there I would also suggest <a href="http://www.nerve.com/regulars/badsex/025/">Trouble in Pornoland</a>. On a side note I found that on Flickr there are multiple interpretations of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jp/tags/gunclub/">girls with guns</a>.
