I have had the chance to try latest builds of Firefox 2 but the documentation for the search plugins appears to be progressing. I've previously mentioned the OpenSearch support.  It looks like it will now also have a mechanism for providing search suggestions from your server using JSON responses. Here are some pages that are likely worth looking at:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Adding_search_engines">Adding Search Engines</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/OpenSearch_support_in_Firefox">OpenSearch Support in Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Supporting_search_suggestions_in_search_plugins">Supporting search suggestions in search plugins</a></li>
</ul>
