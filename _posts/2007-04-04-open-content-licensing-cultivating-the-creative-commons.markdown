New book available that may interest quite a few that deal with copyright or licensing. It also touches on why it is important for some cultural items to be openly accessible.

<blockquote>Open Content Licensing: Cultivating the Creative Commons, a new publication from Sydney University Press, brings together papers from some of the most prominent thinkers of our time on the internet, law and the importance of open content licensing in the digital age. Drawing on material presented at the Queensland University of Technology conference of January 2005, the text provides a snapshot of the thoughts of over 30 Australian and international experts on topics surrounding the international Creative Commons movement, from the landmark Eldred v Ashcroft copyright term decision to the legalities of digital sampling in a remix world.</blockquote>

A pdf version <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00006677/">is available for download</a> as well as <a href="http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/1559">individual chapters</a>. Both released under a CC license of course. Hopefully I'll get time to at least read a few.
