Offline-mode has gotten some press since it was added to the Firefox roadmap. Some of the rails programmers have probably been watching <a href="http://developer.joyent.com/">Joyent Slingshot</a>:

<blockquote>Joyent Slingshot allows developers to deploy Rails applications that work both online and offline (with synchronization), and with drag/drop into and out of the application as in a standard desktop application.</blockquote>

There is also the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/offline">Dojo Offline Toolkit</a>, among many others.

Google has entered the offline app area with an opensource browser plugin called <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/">Google Gears</a> that allows web applications to have an offline mode. <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> already has this mode. I'm guessing gmail will probably follow as well as the office apps.

Probably not useful for many library applications, but something to be aware of.
