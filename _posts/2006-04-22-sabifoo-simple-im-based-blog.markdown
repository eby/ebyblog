Came across a simple blog-like service today called <a href="http://www.sabifoo.com/main">Sabifoo</a>. You add an IM bot to your contact list (aim, yahoo, jabber, MSN) and anything you send it (outside of certain commands) will be put in a sort of blog that has RSS and Web interface. The great thing is you don't have to register presuming you already have an IM account. A page will automatically be created based on your IM account. It also supposed setting up gateways which would be forms that pass the data on to other services. There will probably be a plugin for Wordpress and others before long. For those who just want to start a simple blog this might be a solution. If you just need a simple way to update an RSS feed it may also be useful.
