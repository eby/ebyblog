While I haven't had time to mess around with it, it appears Google has come out with a read/write API that is used for Calendar and most likely other services in the future. From what I'm reading it appears that it's a mix of Atom Store with OpenSearch and APP. It'll be interesting to see how interoperable this is with the individual protocols. It also adds authentication. There's a <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Google_Data_APIs_Protocol">post over at BitWorking that gives a better overview</a>.
