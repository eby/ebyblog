An <a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/eq/eqm06/eqm0632.asp">article on search methods and tools</a> that may be of interest to reference and other librarians.

<blockquote>This article examines alternative engines with unique features that might improve search quality. I also advocate the use of search engines that graphically illustrate what searchers miss when they use only one engine. Finally, the article explores the possibilities for using social bookmarking communities as the ultimate search engine alternative.

Developing good search skills requires study, experimentation, exploration, and a routine for keeping up with the latest developments in search engine technology. That goes for information technologists, instructional technologists, and librarians. As information professionals expand their repertoire of tools and techniques to improve their own search skills, they can in turn educate their end-user communities to do better than just good enough.</blockquote>
