A couple of ajax-type web apps have added "infinite scroll" implementations. The infinite scroll being that when you get near the bottom of the results page it dynamically loads more results. There's no real paging, just loading.

The two apps I've seen it in now are the new <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> when viewing a subscription and the <a href="http://a9.com/">new A9</a> when viewing search results. Supposedly Live.com Search has/had this but doesn't seem to do it now in Firefox.

It's an interesting idea for certain results area or large data sets where it might be useful to add in additional data as needed. I'm still not completely sure on the usability side of things. In the examples above I find the scrollbar jumps around if I'm not holding the mouse down. It also caught me off guard the first time. An interface idea to keep in mind though.
