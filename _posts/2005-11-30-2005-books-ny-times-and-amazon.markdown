The lists are coming out. Looks like there may be some that interest me. You should be able to view the link below but if you need a login try bugmenot.com. I can recommend Freakonomics. I've loved everything by Jared Diamond so far so I presume Collapse will also be good. I really need to make more time for reading books. The amount of shit I enjoy reading online though has taken it's toll.
