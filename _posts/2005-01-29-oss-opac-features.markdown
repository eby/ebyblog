<p><a href="http://www.librarywebchic.net/2005/01/27.html">Library Web Chic</a> has a story about the <a href="http://open-ils.org/">Evergreen project</a> and some of the steps they are taking that go beyond current OPAC's.</p>
<p>Many of the things they are trying are ones I've mention before, including changes with boolean searches and how information is presented. It's good to see projects like this that can experiment with innovative features. Hopefully some of the commercial OPAC providers will pick up on some of these ideas.</p>
