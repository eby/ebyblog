One of my favorite science magazines is <a href="http://seedmagazine.com/">Seed</a> which also hosts a great collection of <a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/">science blogs</a>. Today, via boing boing, I found out that they are <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/20/writer_sued_for_a_ne.html">being sued</a> due to a negative book review. Hopefully it turns out well but it is something to keep an eye on.

That said a negative review has been in me for years and its probably time to let it out before the courts get hold. <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0185183/">Battlefield Earth</a>: complete and utter shit.
