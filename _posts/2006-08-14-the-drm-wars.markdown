A series of posts by Ed Felton regarding the changing arguments for and against DRM.

<blockquote>First, they argue that DRM enables price discrimination Ã¢â‚¬â€ business models that charge different customers different prices for a product Ã¢â‚¬â€ and that price discrimination benefits society, at least sometimes. Second, they argue that DRM helps platform developers lock in their customers, as Apple has done with its iPod/iTunes products, and that lock-in increases the incentive to develop platforms.</blockquote>

And as evidence of this, there's <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/2006/08/04/tg_daily_interviews_universal_pictures/">an interview with a Universal Pictures spokeman</a> about HD-DVD and Blu-Ray that mentions DRM.

<blockquote>DRMs enable business models, they don't stop piracy. And we want to make sure that we have a rich one without making it so easy so that you can violate what we agreed on when you purchased a movie.</blockquote>
