A new service is available called <a href="http://www.tagyu.com/">Tagyu</a>. A suggestion engine for tags. You can put it a URL or text and it will give you some suggested taggings based on others. <a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a> already gives suggestions now so I probably won't use it much. A wordpress plugin suggesting tags (technorati) for posts would be nice, though I've been too lazy to tag posts lately. <del>Web Service for Tagyu is coming soon according to the FAQ.</del> <ins>Update: A <a href="http://tagyu.com/tools/rest">web service interface</a> is now available.</ins>
