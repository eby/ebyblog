As you probably noticed the old ebybox domain is now redirecting to my own. I used to use a subdomain from a friend for my server as it was free. I went ahead and got my own domain since it's so cheap these days and I wanted to have some subdomains of my own. You will now notice that my blog is at blog.ryaneby.com

Thanks to apache redirects you should be able to access all old links from the old domain. If you notice anything screwy let me know. Eventually I'll phase out that domain but I'll leave it up for now. More projects coming soon.
