If you haven't already seen it on <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2006/03/07/2006-library-camp-a-library-20-unconference/">Blyberg's blog</a> or <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/03/april_14_2006_l.html">on Superpatron's</a> there is a sort of informal meetup of lib2.0 people at the Ann Arbor Distric Library. They call it an "unconference" but i'll call it a meetup. There's a <a href="http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/Library_Camp_signup">wiki page for signup</a>. I'm not ashamed to say I'm looking forward to meeting a <a href="http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/User:LesOrchard">non-library person</a> than the lib people. I'm going to try to make it though I have already disagreed with people. Leopold Bros have tolerable beer but nothing fantastic. Would be better to hit up Ashley's or perhaps Arbor Brewing. Nothing in A2'd demands my visit though.
