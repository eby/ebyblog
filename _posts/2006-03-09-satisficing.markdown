I recently finished a book I was reading (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446670251/">Virgin Suicides</a>) and decided to request some of the web development books Amazon has been recommending. They all managed to arrive today and I started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758/">Don't Make Me Think</a>. It was a nice quick read but it manages to fit a lot of good points. Most are common sense but it helps to see them again as they can be lost in debates with librarian ;-)

One of the ideas is that of "satisfice" which is a cross between satisfying and sufficing. It describes the fact that many people will choose the first reasonable item instead of the best one. I was going to write about how this applies to libraries but there is no need. Roy Tennant pointed out in #code4lib that <a title="The Convenience Catastrophe" href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA185367.html">he had already written an article for LJ</a>.Ã‚Â  I recommend reading the article and then reading the book.
