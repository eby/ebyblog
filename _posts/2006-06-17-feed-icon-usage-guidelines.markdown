There was a small snafu when <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/show.dml/295296">Opera changed back to their old rss icon in weekly builds</a> stating that mozilla was requiring the signing of an agreement. I'm uncertain if that has been sorted out but there have been some posts regarding usage guidelines of the icons:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hecker.org/mozilla/feed-icon-guidelines">Proposed Usage Guidelines</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hecker.org/mozilla/feed-icon-faq">FAQ regarding the Usage Guidelines</a></li>
</ul>

From a quick read it appears their major concern is the use of the icon for proprietary feed formats, those that can't be implemented by FOSS developers. I can see that concern coming about when they worked with MS/IE7 and is probably a valid concern. There are also guidelines about color, min-size, etc. It will be interesting to see what the final guidelines look like and what they require.

You can get HQ versions of the icon at <a href="http://feedicons.com/">feedicons.com</a> though not all versions may meet the guidelines it appears.
