An article from <a href="http://chronicle.com/temp/email2.php?id=zht45qPrsddjvvgfcjwWPjxhFwqxyfVX">The Chronicle about one professor's experience using Tor on campus</a>:

<h3>Caught in the Network</h3>

The Chronicle Review - From the issue dated February 9, 2007

<blockquote>But it is being used all around the world, by people in countries that restrict their access to information, by corporate whistle-blowers, and by digital-rights activists. It's even being used by average people like me, as a way to keep innocuous and personal online activities private.

So in the head-on collision between my appreciation of the role IT staff members play on my campus and my understanding of the role I have to play for my students, my need for academic freedom won. I found myself lecturing my three visitors into near catatonia about the uses of Tor.</blockquote>
