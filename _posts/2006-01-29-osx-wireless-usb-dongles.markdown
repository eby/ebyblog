In the ramp up to Code4LibCon I've been getting some equipment I should have got a long time ago, such as a bigger SD card for my camera. Another is wireless for my iBook. Unfortunately I have an older iBook that only supports the original Airport cards which are now no longer produced and run $100+ even on ebay. I began a quest to find a USB dongle that would work instead which wasn't an easy task. Casey <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/10794/">had an old list of campatibility</a> but I found most of those weren't sold anymore as well or had poor ratings.

Luckily I came across a <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/21267">Ask MetaFilter post</a> that <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/21267#344187">had a comment</a> which linked to the <a href="http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm">RT2500 chipset drivers</a> and a <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/">page of USB dongles</a> that use it. I'm still looking through the list to see which one I was but from the reviews it appears that many support OSX 10.4.x well.

Oh, and if your looking for a good place to buy computer equipment, I recommend <a href="http://newegg.com">NewEgg</a>.
