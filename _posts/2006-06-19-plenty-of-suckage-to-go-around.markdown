I won't both linking to all the applicable posts. <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2006/06/18/opacs-in-the-frying-pan-vendors-in-the-fire/">Blyberg has a nice round-up</a> and I recommend reading all of the linked items to get an idea of the dialogue going on.

There has been an increase in discussion about where OPAC's are heading or should head. My personal opinion is that there will be commonalities but that each library and community is a bit different so there is no one grand ideal. With that in mind the ability to highly customize will be increasingly important. Whether it's more modular design or just API/data feeds is up for argument.

One thing that I don't think is worth time arguing about is who's fault it is. No vendor really pushed much innovation and no library really demanded it until now. Lets all get working.
