Another election cycle, another year of voting problems. Here are some recent posts that are worth a read and as usual the debate in the comments are worth it as well.

<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/11/voting_technolo.html">Voting Technology and Security</a>

<blockquote>Last week in Florida's 13th Congressional district, the victory margin was only 386 votes out of 153,000. There'll be a mandatory lawyered-up recount, but it won't include the almost 18,000 votes that seem to have disappeared. The electronic voting machines didn't include them in their final tallies, and there's no backup to use for the recount. </blockquote>

<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/11/more_on_electro.html">More on electronic voting machines</a>

<blockquote>One of the dumber comments I hear about electronic voting goes something like this: "If we can secure multi-million-dollar financial transactions, we should be able to secure voting." Most financial security comes through audit: names are attached to every transaction, and transactions can be unwound if there are problems. Voting requires an anonymous ballot, which means that most of our anti-fraud systems from the financial world don't apply to voting.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/11/the_need_for_pr.html">The need for professional election officials</a>:

<blockquote>In the U.S., elections are run by an army of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. These are both Republicans and Democrats, and the idea is that the one group watches the other: security by competing interests. But at the top are state-elected or -appointed officials, and many election shenanigans in the past several years have been perpetrated by them.</blockquote>

And finally <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6439233">Jimmy Carter chimes in on US elections in response to whether his foundation could watch them</a>:

<blockquote>But there's no doubt in my mind that the United States electoral system is severely troubled and has many faults in it. It would not qualify at all for instance for participation by the Carter Center in observing. We require for instance that there be uniform voting procedures throughout an entire nation. In the United States you've got not only fragmented from one state to another but also from one county to another. There is no central election commission in the United States that can make final judgment. It's a cacophony of voices that come in after the election is over with, thousands or hundreds of lawyers contending with each other. There's no uniformity in the nation at all. There's no doubt that that there's severe discrimination against poor people because of the quality of voting procedures presented to them. Another thing in the United States that we wouldn't permit in a country other than the United States is that we require that every candidate in a country in which we monitor the elections have equal access to the major news media, regardless of how much money they have. In the United States, as you know, it's how much advertising you can by on television and radio.</blockquote>
