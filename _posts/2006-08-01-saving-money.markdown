Lifehack.org has a post on <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/8-expenses-to-cut-and-how.html">8 Expenses to Cut and How</a>. One of the suggestions is to use a local library.

<blockquote>Libraries have changed. Most libraries are now connected into a big sharing consortium, expanding the collection of what you can take out and what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have that you might want. Further, most now have an online catalog that you can use to browse and request from home. Libraries now frequently stock DVDs (mine favors Hollywood movies, and the one in the next town features mostly highbrow independent stuff). Heck, my library just launched a big commercial digital audiobook download deal, so I can get books on my computer from my desk.</blockquote>

I've done similar and now really only read books that friends loan me or that are at the library. Most of my reading is technical though and I find the books are obsolete before I even finish them. Some of the other suggestions that I follow:

<ul>
<li>Use Netflix</li>
<li>Drink at home/at friends</li>
<li>Make coffee instead of going to the coffee shop</li>
</ul>

While Netflix is a monthly charge, I've found that I end up saving since I no longer rent/buy movies or go to the theatre. It also prevents me from going out all the time and spending money. I dropped my WoW account as well. I also don't have TV and just rent shows when they come out on DVD.

As for the drinking, I went a step further and brew my own beer, though I've been lazy lately. It is quite the savings, especially if you drink decent beers.

Coffee, I also roast at home. You can get premium coffees for less then it costs pre-roasted and the green coffee beans stay fresh for quite some time. You just roast what you need and you always have the freshest pot. I can buy a pound for the price of a grande at the local coffee place.
