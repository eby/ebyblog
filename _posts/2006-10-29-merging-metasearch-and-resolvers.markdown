<a href="http://www.wallandbinkley.com/quaedam/?p=85">pbinkley writes about the problem with OpenURL resolvers and how augmenting them with outside data may help</a>. I do like some of the things <a href="http://findit.library.gatech.edu/">Umlaut</a> is doing and I'm hopeful that things improve. Worth a read.

<blockquote>Give me good detailed metadata and my resolver should nail it for you first time; give me vague or faulty metadata and my search service should kick in to help you find your path.</blockquote>
