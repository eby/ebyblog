<p>Not that I post that often but though I'd mentioned that I've been swamped with support calls for the start of the semester. It seems like everyone is using our online course system now for something, even if it's only for posting the syllabus. I personally handled around 60 calls per day for awhile there not including emails.</p>
<p>One this to note though, is that most students seem to expect things to be online now. I had quite a few call because they wanted to read their syllabus online only to hear back from the instructor that they were not using the course system. I forsee our work load increasing steadily over the coming years as more professors become comfortable with the system. Not sure if anyone else is noticing this trend at their institutions</p>
<p>Things are slowing down so I should be posting a bit more often in the future.</p>
