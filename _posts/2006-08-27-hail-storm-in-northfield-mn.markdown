There's a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/northfield_mn/sets/72157594249857562/">rather amazing photoset on Flickr of a hail storm in Northfield, MN</a> with hail the size of softballs. Quite a bit of damage, including a greenhouse destroyed. Community photos look to be organized by a local citizen group.
