My new T-shirt arrived from the great web-comic <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">Diesel Sweeties</a>.

Goes well with my t-shirt from my favorite comic, <a href="http://achewood.com/">Achewood</a>

Both are worth reading from the beginning. A <a href="http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09022005">recent one on web-access</a> is currently stuck in my mind. Both comics are not for the easily offended.
