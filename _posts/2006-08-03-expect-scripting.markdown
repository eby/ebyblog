<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/07/28/218250">Linux.com has a small article on expect scripting. </a> For those not familiar, expect scripts allow you to script interactive interfaces. In libraries, for example, you can use it to log in to the ILS and do some tasks at a set schedule. This can help make up for missing features or the lack of a cron facility. We use it here to refresh book lists. Something to look into if you haven't already.
