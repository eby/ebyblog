Salon has been providing full-text of stories with their podcasts so you can view it in the description area on the ipod. They have decided to take it a step further and provide other stories that don't have audio with mp3's of silence. A clever hack to get text to auto-sync with the ipod. There are already apps available to download rss and other formats and move the text to the ipod notes area. This is an interesting way to get iTunes to do similar.
