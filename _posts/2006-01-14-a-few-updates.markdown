If you hadn't already noticed, Wordpress 2.0 is out. I've upgraded this blog. I also went ahead a switched themes to play around with. I'm also trying out Feedburner. There is no need to update your feeds as I'm using redirects. I apologize if things show up as new. I will hopefully not screw with the feeds from now on. Let me know if you notice any problems.
