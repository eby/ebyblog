Or so says the Department of Homeland Security's US-CERT office. Good advice to say the least. If you don't expect software then don't accept. A bit harder when your not actually given much of a choice. Other good advice of never running as an administrator though that is rarely done due to laziness. Also read EULA's but what I've read is that the Sony EULA does not actually list half the shit it does. More info at the link below.

Also, if your not a member of the EFF I suggest joining. I try to give as much as my college student funds can afford.
