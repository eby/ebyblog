I was originally going to post more indepth but probably won't get the time soon. There was a <a href="http://techessence.info/node/19">post over at techessence regarding library presence in online course systems</a>, which is one of my main interests. From the post:

<blockquote>Distance learners in many schools can do almost everything school-related within their online courseware. Their syllabi are there, their readings are there, their professors are there (through the online communication system), and their mechanisms for getting help are there. The only thing that may not be there is the library.</blockquote>

They also link to an interesting article which I still have to read. I've linked to a couple others that look applicable/interesting as well.
