<blockquote>Being able to preserve digital data is a must for a golden age of research information, and a major risk is therefore the rapid obsolescence of digital objects. File formats, software, and hardware are constantly being superseded, so the curation of digital objects involves regularly migrating files into currently supported formats.  Who will do this for important research information long after the original research group has been disbanded?  Memory institutions such as libraries and archives will have a role, but research disciplines must also assist in identifying the intrinsic qualities that need to be preserved during migration.</blockquote>
