The 100+ Johns Talis warned us about are at it again. This time providing <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2005/12/01/enhanced-patron-history/" title="blyberg.net Ã‚Â» Enhanced Patron History">Enhanced Patron History</a> outside of the OPAC. What I like about this implementation is that it's Opt-In and extensible. I have a feeling that the data will be much more usable being it's outside the OPAC. Add on that it's opt-in and you have a very useful service that patrons can use if they choose. I have a feeling that if this was a product that there wouldn't have been that consideration. I'll be interested in seeing how people take advantage of this feature and how John uses it to enhance the various services. Statistics would also be nice. I'd be interesting in seeing how many books I've checked out in a time period, how long I had them out, fiction vs non-fiction, etc.
