Seed Magazine has a coming issue on the 25th anniversery of HIV/AIDS and of the XVI International AIDS Conference. I'm still trying to get my library to subscribe (great science magazine) but they have a lot of coverage online. There's some nice infographics in a recent post and some other great posts as well.

<li><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aids/">Coverage of the conference at ScienceBlogs.com</a></li>
</ul>

There quite a few posts on the scienceblogs referring to the anniversery. I recommend taking a look around. Not sure if any libraries did anything to mark the anniversery.
