So I got a few posts in the ILS Data series out. I'm not trying to cover many details, provide spec sheets or serve as comparison shopping. I'm just documenting some ILS users' experiences using their data to see what the landscape looks like. Here are the posts so far:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/ils-data-evergreen/">ILS Data: Evergreen</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/ils-data-voyager/">ILS Data: Voyager</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/ils-data-millenium-iii/">ILS Data: Millenium</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/ils-data-koha/">ILS Data: Koha</a></li>
</ul>

There will likely be more to come. However if you've had experiences building on top of these products or exporting and processing information please leave a comment. If you have experience with another product I haven't profiled please leave a comment here. What I'm looking for is export, database access and web service abilities. Also included whether they are base or you had to pay extra.

I am using customer experiences as having a feature does not mean it's usable. In some of the products the lack of documentation can make it difficult or the output may not be valid. Again, if your experience varies please leave a comment. I don't moderate except for obvious spam.
