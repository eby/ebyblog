So far there has not really been any overview of what has actually been &quot;broken&quot; and what the consequences of some of the recent finds are. Basicly there is a gaping hole in our understanding of how things work which prevents us from making any definitive conclusions about the meaning of events occured. The biggest gap being the Subset-Difference technique used by AACS. With this post/article I would like to fill this particular gap.</li>
