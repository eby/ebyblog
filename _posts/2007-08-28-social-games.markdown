One of benefits of gaming that fits well with libraries, is the social aspect. The library provides a neutral place for gaming that allows for competition while remaining sane. While most seem to be focused on console games it's nice to see places like <a href="http://lib.uah.edu/lanparty/">UAH Library</a> also do a LAN Party.

As for the social aspect, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/wil_wheaton_key_1.html">there is a keynote from PAX 2007 by Wil Wheaton</a> that appears to be worth a listen.
