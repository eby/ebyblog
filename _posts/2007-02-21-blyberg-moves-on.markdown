John <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2007/02/20/moving-on/">has announced his move to Darien Public Library</a>. It will be sad to see him leave Michigan as it was nice to see some of his work being in the state as it gave other local libraries the idea that things could indeed be done and not just at the heavy name large institutions.

I'm also glad to see him going on to Darien which, with Alan Gray, will likely mean some advancements in both the online and offline world of public libraries. I worry some for AADL as they have obviously lost some mind share but the infrastructure he laid down should help whoever comes after. At least a vendor hasn't gotten him yet.
