Somehow I missed this one but it appears <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/index.php/weblog/permalink/blackboard_patents_the_lms/">Blackboard has been awarded a patent</a> that covers quite a bit of modern Learning Management Systems do. They have <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33396">already taken legal action against Desire2Learn</a>.
