<a href="http://q6.oclc.org/">Jeff Young of OCLC is now blogging</a>. Looks like he's centering on OpenURL for now. If you follow OpenURL then you'll likely want to keep track. He's <a href="http://q6.oclc.org/2006/08/openurl_object.html">working on an OpenURL Object Model</a> which may prove useful. Can't say I understand any of it though.
