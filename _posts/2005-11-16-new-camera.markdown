<p>Finally broke down and got a camera. Expect to see a large increase in my photo usage and Flickr madness.<br />
<br />
I chose the SD400 as there were some temporary deals that dropped it by over a hundred bucks. Also have very high ratings. Unfortunately that does not come through with my caffeine hands and small SD card I have right now. Once I get a bigger card and learn all the settings then expect hopefully some better pics.<br />
<br />
I would have like a full fledged DSLR but my main interest is getting something small that I'll actually take around with me. This one is small, about the same size as my 2nd gen iPod. Very tasty.<br />

For the interested <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canonsd400/">Here's the DPReview of it.</a></p>
