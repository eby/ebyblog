Some humor for this less than fantastic friday. Read the <a href="http://www.drivl.com/posts/view/494">full post over at drivl</a> about how real life and movies differ when it comes to coding.

<blockquote>10. Most code is not inherently cross platform

Remember in Independence Day when whatshisface-math-guy writes a virus that works on both his apple laptop AND an alien mothership?  Bullshit! If real life were like film I'd be able to port wordpress to my toaster using a cat5 cable and a bag of glitter.</blockquote>
