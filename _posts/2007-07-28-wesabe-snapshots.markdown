I've talked before about <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">Wesabe</a> and that I use it for some of my finances. They've added a new feature which is probably one of the most useful things I've used recently. It's called <a href="http://blog.wesabe.com/index.php/2007/07/25/one-more-thing-browser-snapshot-and-file-attachments/">Browser Snapshots and it uses a Firefox extension to let you capture images of receipt screens and upload them straight to your account</a> and then attach them to any transaction. I've already used it quite a bit this month. It's the small features that can make a huge difference in organization.
