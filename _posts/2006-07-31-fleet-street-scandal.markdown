My homestead seriously lacks some art. I found some nice ones over at <a href="http://www.fleetstreetscandal.com/">Fleet Street Scandal</a> that also seem decently priced (ones I checked were $20 and ok sized). Haven't ordered yet but plan on it. This post is mostly as a reminder for me.

<blockquote>All of our artwork is professionally printed in-house on heavy 100% cotton rag archival stock using an 8-color printing process. Each print is individually signed by the artist. Every print is open edition unless otherwise noted.</blockquote>

Eventually I'll try my hand at some bob ross or something. Need more hobbies that allow drinking and smoking at the same time.
