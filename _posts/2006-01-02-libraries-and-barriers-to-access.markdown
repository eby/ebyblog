Some great things I've been meaning to say but never did were posted in much better prose than I could have by dchud. <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/node/7">The first hit on the failings of some of the resolvers out there</a>. The first batch of implementations that I've seen have left me wanting and there was even one that was just a loop from the catalog back to itself. He also touches on the poor error handling. I'll just sum it all up and say that too much of this is a pain in the ass to use and there is no need for it to be that way (OPAC and things related to the OPAC).

<a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/node/8">A second post talks about barriers to information</a>. Right now in many institutions, patrons are forced to jump through 50 flaming hoops to get anything done. Whether its digging through 3 sites to find the proper link, setting up proxy servers or solving riddles to put a book on hold, some things could definitely be easier. As dchud states:

<blockquote>The choice we librarians need to make about the fall of our own barriers -- and, I'll predict, 2006 is the year to make our choice -- is whether we wield the hammers ourselves, or whether we read about it online.</blockquote>
