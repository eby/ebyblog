The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/magazine/14publishing.html?ex=1305259200&en=c07443d368771bb8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">an article on the various book scanning projects and what it means</a>. It's a decent read.

<blockquote>For 2,000 years, the universal library, together with other perennial longings like invisibility cloaks, antigravity shoes and paperless offices, has been a mythical dream that kept receding further into the infinite future.

Until now.</blockquote>
