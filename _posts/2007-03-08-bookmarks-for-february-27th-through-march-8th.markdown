<li><a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page">Main Page - OpenWetWare</a> - OpenWetWare is an effort to promote the sharing of information, know-how, and wisdom among researchers and groups who are working in biology &amp; biological engineering.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macresearch.org/getting_things_done_gtd_for_scientists">Getting Things Done (GTD) for Scientists - MacResearch</a> - Furthermore, I think it is a very useful system for scientists to employ to organize the barrage of different projects they have running at time, from research projects, to authoring articles, to writing grant proposals. There is a lot of concurrency in a scientist?s work, and GTD can really help.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/web-misunderstandards.php">Design View / Andy Rutledge - Web Misunderstandards</a> - It may seem counterintuitive, but while design has nothing to do with Web standards, Web standards do actually have a lot to do with design. Web standards expand the scope and effectiveness of design, given the context of the medium. When you recognize that design is an effort at communication, and that Web standards allow for greatly increased access to that communication, the benefit of their connection is clear.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/web-standards.php">Design View / Andy Rutledge - Web Standards: it's about quality, not compliance</a> - Too many fail to grasp the relevant point: it is not ?eyes? that access websites and online applications; it is unpredictable human beings of varying abilities, technologies of varying platforms, and important indexing engines that access these things. So websites and online applications must be conceived and built in accordance with what works best in this broad context ? and in accordance with the idea that it?s not okay to build things that easily break due to low quality construction.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.attacklab.net/showdown-gui.html">Showdown - Markdown in Javascript</a> - Could be useful for previews, etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/2A351C60-A4E5-4764-A083-FF8610E66A46.html">How FairPlay Works: Apple's iTunes DRM Dilemma</a> - Understanding how Apple?s FairPlay DRM works helps to answer a lot of questions: why it hasn?t been replaced with an open, interoperable DRM that anyone can use, why Apple isn?t broadly licensing FairPlay, and why the company hasn?t jumped to add DRM-free content from indie artists to iTunes.</li>
<li><a href="http://stuckincustoms.com/?p=548">Stuck In Customs » Blog Archive » HDR Tutorial - Featuring HDR 2.0</a> - HDR is short for High Dynamic Range. It is a software technique of taking either one image or a series of images, combining them, and adjusting the contrast ratios to do things that are virtually impossible with a single aperture and shutter speed.</li>
