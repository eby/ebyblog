I won't repost everything that's stated here but the gist of it is aggregating various feeds from a persons life into their e-portfolio. A feed from a LMS (Blackboard, ANGEL, etc), a feed from a publishing system (journals, DSpace, etc), a feed from HR/Career system (resume, goals, etc) and even a feed from a persons professional development blog. 

A very interesting use of aggregating information. I've thought along similar lines for this site to bring in all the facets of my life (reading, watching, enjoying, linking, etc) but had never thought about it's application to e-portfolios. Give it a read:
