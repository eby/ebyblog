Not completely my opinion but <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/oct/02/libraries_are_limited_obsolete/">there is an op-ed piece that is worth reading</a>. It's also worth reading the comments/responses. From the piece:

<blockquote>Rather than build an expensive new library downtown in the mistaken belief that such a monument to 19th century information technology will bring the community together, the city of Lawrence needs to consider the real advantages to bringing our entire communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s information infrastructure into the 21st century.</blockquote>

I should note that <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2006/10/06/going-to-the-boneyard/">blyberg has a nice post talking about this</a>.
