Two new beta offerings. <a href="http://hellodeo.com/hello">Hellodeo</a> is a video/webcam sharing service similar to odeo's audio voicemail offering. <a href="http://odeo.com/play">Odeo Play</a> is another way to browse the site with a more ajaxy interface. Has things such popular items, recently played, etc. The video will likely interest people more.

The are apparently behind the new SMS/social site <a href="http://twttr.com/">twttr</a>
