Haven't had time to mess around with it but looks like it might be promising. <a href="http://wiki.bibliontology.com/index.php/Main_Page">From the wiki</a>:

<blockquote>The Bibliographic Ontology Specification provides main concepts and properties for describing citations and bibliographic references (i.e. quotes, books, articles, etc) on the Semantic Web.</blockquote>

There is a draft of the <a href="http://wiki.bibliontology.com/index.php/Ontology_Working_Draft">ontology available on the wiki as well</a>. For those who like examples <a href="http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/15/describing-documents-articles-series-volumes-and-conferences-using-the-bibliographic-ontology/">there are a couple on fgiasson.com</a>:

<blockquote>I created some examples to see if I could easily describe two articles I wrote in the past few years: (1) and accepted article in a proceeding and (2) a refused article submitted for a conference. I was wondering if the current state of the ontology could easily cope with some weird cases. As you will notice bellow, it nicely described some weird cases that I encountered while describing these articles.</blockquote>
