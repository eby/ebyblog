<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/ella-21/">Wordpress 2.1 is out</a>. Again it was about a 10 second upgrade <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/easy-wordpress-upgrades-with-svn/">with svn</a>. Some of the features that look useful:

<ul>
<li>Autosave</li>
<li>Page as front page built in (useful for CMS type installs)</li>
<li>Upload manager</li>
<li>Pseudo-cron and error class for plugins</li>
</ul>

A nice addition is the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/">voting for future enhancements</a>. Nice to see outside of the normal forum posts.
