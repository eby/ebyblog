There's plenty of comments regarding the Gorman blogging but I like this snippet from within <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2007/06/13/old_revolutions_good_new_revolutions_bad_a_response_to_gorman.php">Clay Shirkey's response</a>:

<blockquote>Academic libraries, which in earlier days provided a service, have outsourced themselves as bouncers to publishers like Reed-Elsevier; their principal job, in the digital realm, is to prevent interested readers from gaining access to scholarly material.</blockquote>

Karen Schneider gave <a href="http://code4lib.org/2007/schneider">a keynote at code4lib</a> that touched on the outsourcing problem, which <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/code4lib2007-karens-keynote/">I've mentioned here before</a>. I recommend giving the video a watch if you haven't already.
