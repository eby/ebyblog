Sessions is an online school for graphic design. Students enroll and eventually have a curriculum that they go through online. To help automate things they built an application called Student Tracker which allows students to keep a grip on their program. Some points:

<ul>
<li>Three systems linked together. ANGEL, SIS and the Tracker</li>
<li>When they login to ANGEL they have a screen with their user information, current courses and future courses.</li>
<li>An ANGEL survey is used to update contact information. The SIS pulls the results from it.</li>
<li>Students can extend courses using a button under the current list. Small extensions automatically approved</li>
<li>Also button to start next course. Requires coordinator approval</li>
<li>Inserted like any other nugget on My Page</li>
</ul>
