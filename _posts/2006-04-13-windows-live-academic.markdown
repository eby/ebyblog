I haven't really tested it much in terms of actual use but I did find the interface interesting. I've been messing around with various interface ideas using the III XML Server and this gives another one for ideas. You can <a href="http://academic.live.com/">check it out yourself</a>. There's probably plenty of things I would change though. I'd probably have to pre-fetch the records to get decent rollover response as well. Not sure though.
