A hodgepodge of parts. Ignore the nasty looking speakers and monitor riser things. Hopefully can get some better looking stuff eventually.

<h4>Software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gentoo Linux</li>
<li>KDE</li>
<li>Small partition with Windows XP for occasional testing</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hardware</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dell GX6?? something</li>
<li>Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.00GHz</li>
<li>2Gb RAM</li>
<li>250GB SATA</li>
<li>2 Gateway monitors, one on DVI and the other on VGA</li>
</ul>

It came with only windows but I couldn't help myself. Since the Pentium D is dual-core I was able to get it to show up in linux as dual processors. It's capable of 64-bit but I decided to stick with 32-bit since it's mature and I'm using things like Reiser4 which made it difficult to find good install disks that weren't DVD.

Overall I'm really impressed with the speed and ease and I haven't really tweaked anything yet.
