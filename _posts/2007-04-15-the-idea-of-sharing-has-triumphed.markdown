Via <a href="http://www.web2learning.net/archives/957">What I Learned Today</a>, I came across an older talk (but recently posted) by Eben Moglen called <a href="http://osc.gigavox.com/shows/detail1712.html">The Renaissance of Invention: Free Software and the Next American Century</a>. I used to try to keep up on much of IT Conversations but have fallen quite behind with everything that's going on. If you haven't already I recommend giving it a listen.

There's also <a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/unix/bsd/archives/oscon-day-5-10795">a nice roundup on a ittoolbox blog</a>:

<blockquote>The critical question is "do users have rights?" including the rights to creativity. His clients are afraid that patents are going to destroy their work. The 20 year exclusive ownership of an idea is an abomination. Speak loudly with licenses. We have to protect the right to share.</blockquote>

A great speaker and I think it's perfect timing with the upcoming <a href="http://www.techsource.ala.org:80/ltr/">ALA TechSource</a> written by <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/">Casey</a> that will be coming out in the nearish future.
