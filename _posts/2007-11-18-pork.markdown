We eat quite a bit of pork and since we're both from farming backgrounds, figured we'd take a stab at growing some. Living in the city doesn't really allow it (we're trying to move where we could), but luckily some farmer friends grew some for us. They tend to grow rather quickly over the year, starting off rather small in the spring.

And they end up pretty damn big at the end:

Skinning is probably the most involved of the process, with lots of slicing. It took about an hour with three people.

The cutting goes rather quickly and was almost a social event.

We ended up taking half a pig home, giving the other half to the girlfriend's brother and sister in law. Overall a good yield, with plenty of bacon, loin and roasting meat. We're not fans of ham.
