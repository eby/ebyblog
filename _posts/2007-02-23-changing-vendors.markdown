Liblime acquired Katipo Communications' Koha Division. <a href="http://oss4lib.org/node/538">The press release reads like PR</a> but had a nice tidbit:

<blockquote>The acquisition also highlights one of the unique features of an open-source business and development model: "Katipo's Koha customers don't need to worry about switching to a new ILS," explains Rachel Hamilton, Director of Katipo Communications. "With open source, switching vendors doesn't mean switching software. I'm confident that LibLime will provide our Koha libraries with the professional service they have come to expect." No vendor lock-in means that Koha users can choose what level of commercial support, if any, they require.</blockquote>
