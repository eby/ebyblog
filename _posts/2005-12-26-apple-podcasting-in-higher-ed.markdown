            Well I might have mixed thoughts about podcasting in higher ed. I think some will get it right while others may not. I like the direction it's going though.

Apple seems to think it's going to happen in a big way and has an <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/solutions/podcasting/server.html">integrated blog server and podcasting support</a> in the 10.4 OSX Server. Not sure how many use xservs but it's an interesting development.
