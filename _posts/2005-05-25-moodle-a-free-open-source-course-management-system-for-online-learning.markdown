<a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle - A Free, Open Source Course Management System for Online Learning</a>

An interesting course management system. Our University currently uses <a href="http://cyberlearninglabs.com/products/">ANGEL</a> ,which I like as a student and staff much more than Blackboard. This software looks very similar in scope though it's OSS. One of the many things I like about ANGEL, though not open source, is that we tend to have freedom to fix things ourselves. Moodle might be a definite plus for those small universities or organizations that want to offer online training.
