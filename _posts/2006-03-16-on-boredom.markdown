<blockquote>Whenever people tell me that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bored, I often find myself telling them that I love being bored. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m wrong, of course. I mean that I love being aimless Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fiddling about with whateverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at hand. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really know what it is to be bored any more.</blockquote>

A <a href="http://www.rotational.co.uk/2006/03/boredom/">good post over at Rotational</a> which aligns with how I experience things. My experience has also been that others think I'm bored when I'm just enjoying the world quietly. That and my use of the word "fine" to describe everything.
