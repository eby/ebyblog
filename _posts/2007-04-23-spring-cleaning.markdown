I've been under the weather for the last week or so. The random weather here in Michigan isn't helping. It looks like it might be warming up more permanently now, although the greenhouse says they expect one more cold snap (so aren't selling an vegetables yet).

The garden will likely have to wait but I was able to get rid of a few eye sores. There were about 4 stumps in my girl-friend's yard as she had some dead trees that were becoming a liability.

The biggest one had to be trimmed down some and then ground for a couple hours:

And now I have plenty of mulch for about two yards:

If you know someone with a stump-grinder I recommend seeing if you can get a deal. We've rented grinders before but they don't compare with a professional grinder.

Now I just need to clean up my iTunes and Documents folder.
