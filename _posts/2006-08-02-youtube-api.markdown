For those libraries posting videos online and who want to save some bandwidth by posting to video sites, YouTube looks like it may be the one to try out. I checked Google Video but they don't seem to have an API up yet (I presume they will in the future). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/dev">YouTube has a page describing their API</a> which supports REST and XML-RPC. The feature most will be interested will be the ability to pull videos by user. This will allow your library to upload to YouTube and create a page on your site that pulls in all the video automatically. They already appears to be some plugins for Wordpress and from the API information it doesn't look like it would be difficult to integrate with a site with some basic programming skills. Just an option for some libraries.
