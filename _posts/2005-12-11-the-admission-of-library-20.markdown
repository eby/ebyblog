Casey gives a <a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/10957/">good description of Library 2.0</a> and why it's useful. I'm in the camp that it's a buzzword and might be overkill. However I reduce it to something really simple: change. By using the term I think it makes the statement that libraries MUST change. Admitting this can be hard for some but having an umbrella term can be helpful. Some things are already done in some cases but the discussion of the future is important and the required changes more so.
