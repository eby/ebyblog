An <a href="http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/glWeb/Projects/spl/spl.html">interesting data visualization</a> being done at the Seattle Central Library involving items that are being checked out. In this case it is an art installation but I can see this being cool in any library.

I'm not sure about the <a href="http://www.spl.org/images/slideshow/NewCentralSlideshow.asp">new design of the library</a> though. The building itself looks great but the inside looks too industrial/trade show for me. Does not look warm and inviting compared to some of the other libraries I've seen.
