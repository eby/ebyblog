A talk by Lorcan Dempsey of OCLC at Edinburgh University Library. The topic is The digital library landscape and trends in the world of Web 2.0. I'm still watching it so can't give much of a review. <a href="http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/001054.html">Lorcan talks about it at his blog</a>.

The library offers a <a href="http://nevis.lib.ed.ac.uk/lorcan_dempsey_archive.asx">windows media stream of the talk</a> online. I've been messing with some transcoding with mplayer and ffmpeg so I went ahead and dumped the stream and transcoded to mpeg-4 in an ipod video friendly format. I'm still getting a hang on all the options so there isn't really any metadata in the file and it doesn't appear to let you scan correctly. You can fast forward though. The slides show up pretty well on my ipod.
