There's <a href="http://engtech.wordpress.com/2006/07/28/google-code-project-hosting-a-replacement-for-sourceforge/">an overview at engtech</a>. Definitely not a replacement for sourceforge but a nice compliment, especially for smaller projects. The most useful feature will likely be the 100MB subversion per project (more at request). This might increase the number of small, but useful projects that are out there available for download. <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Take a look</a>. Those libraries creating hacks for their systems might find it useful. I still like the idea of a centralized library subversion server though.
