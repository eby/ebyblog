Here are a couple I've found useful lately:

<h4><a href="http://www.sysint.no/nedlasting/mbrfix.htm">MBR Fix</a></h4>

A command utility that allows you to fix the MBR while logged into Windows. I moved my linux to another comp and wanted to get the one I was on up and running again. I had neither the windows boot cd or the Administrator password. However the user I was logged in as had Admin rights. Just ran the utility from the command line and presto. Was a lot quicker then going through the recovery console. You can also backup or move MBR records with it. You can <a href="http://www.download.com/MbrFix/3000-2094_4-10485991.html">download it here</a>.

<h4><a href="http://www.autopatcher.com/">AutoPatcher</a></h4>

A single download of all the Windows updates for 2000/XP/2003. It will extract everything to a folder and has a program you run that will search for ones already installed. Also includes some tweaks and registry hacks. This can come in handy if you have a computer that is on a less then stellar internet connection somewhere. Run to the library or somewhere and download the file. You can burn the extracted directory to a CD or copy to a flash drive if it's big enough. The patch presumes you already have the latest Service Pack. If you don't, get that first and then use AutoPatcher.

The only thing I found is that it has all of the patches MS releases for that Windows version and may not be specific for what you have installed. Windows Update showed no updates at all but AutoPatcher had plenty, many of which were for locales, etc that I didn't use. I suppose it never hurts.
