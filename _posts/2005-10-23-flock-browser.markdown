<p>I went ahead and tried out <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>. If you haven't already give it a try. Firefox with a theme and some extra features. It's geared for people that use the web alot and specifically blog,flickr, etc.</p><p>You can read a <a href="http://www.paulstamatiou.com/2005/10/21/flock-under-those-feathers/">nice indeph review over at PaulStamatiou.</a></p><p>My thoughts are that the blog and del.icio.us integration is quite nice. On the otherhand I'm unsure if a new browser is necessary. I would much prefer it to be extensions/themes/plugins for the actual Firefox. I already use <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious/">Foxylicious</a> to download my del.icio.us bookmarks. I prefer this anyways as it's easy to have private and public bookmarks and I don't mind using the bookmarklet. The blogging tool would be nice to have in Firefox though.</p><p>Hopefully someone will make a nice blogging extension if they haven't already. I would definitely use it at work. Overall Flock is a really neat browser but just not worth changing to for me. I'll stick with Firefox and extensions.</p>
<p>I should note that I posted this via Flock</p>
