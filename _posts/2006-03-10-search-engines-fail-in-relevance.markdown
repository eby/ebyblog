Results from a study done by a course. Some interesting findings.

<blockquote>Google and Yahoo tied for first place, with a rating of 2.3, but the most striking result is undoubtedly the extremely low level of user satisfaction. None of the search engines even passed (2.5 out of 5) and some of the grades were extremely low (1.2 for VoilÃƒÂ ). Links graded as 0 (totally useless) were astonishingly numerous: 53.1% for VoilÃƒÂ , but even the best didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do much better: 28.6% for Google and 27.7% for Yahoo. Conversely, results graded as 5 (excellent) failed to reach even 16% for the top two search engines.</blockquote>
