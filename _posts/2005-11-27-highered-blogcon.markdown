Planning appears to be happening regarding an online conference about higher ed and new technologies. Nice to see that they are having a Library/Information track. As a former education major (and one that was into the tech side) I'll definitely be keeping my eye on this one. Being online I might actually be able to "go" for once.

They are looking for proposals and ideas for the Library Track. For those who do such things it may be an interesting time with the possible interactive technologies such as screencasts, etc. Having an online conference gives some challenges and flexibility.
