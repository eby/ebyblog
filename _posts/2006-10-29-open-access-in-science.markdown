There's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2006/10/sfn_revolution_in_scientific_p.php">a nice summary of a panel</a> called "(R)evolution in Scientific Publishing: How will it Affect You?" that was held apparently at the Society for Neuroscience conference. There's some interesting discussion and I'm also a little amazed that no one seemed to understand blogging. There are some issues that come up:

<blockquote>Say for instance Open Access is taken to fruition. Then every time I post on a scientific paper, I can cite the paper and include portions of it. This has the possible benefit of people checking that what I said was correct and conveying science to a much larger audience. It could also have the drawback in that correct citation can become an issue. Also, if I post the Open Access article is it still copyrighted? What if the version is updated?</blockquote>

I wouldn't be surprised if <a href="http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/">darcus</a> is working on similar problems. This could also tie into some of the API and structured data work that is being done in libraryland. There was a librarian there and it was nice to see the blame shared:

<blockquote>Libraries are also at fault for failing to use their economic clout to demand larger access.</blockquote>
