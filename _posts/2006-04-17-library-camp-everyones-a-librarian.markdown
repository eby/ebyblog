Was also called "Personal digital asset management". This discussion focused on digital lifestyle and how to organize it. As more and more people begin to packrat in their digital life they will need ways to cope with the information overload. I missed the first part of this discussion.

<ul>
<li>Lots of duplication, things can get lost in the noise. Tools are out there. iTunes will find duplicate songs. Believe there are hacks for iPhoto, etc. Desktop search may move into this area.</li>
<li>Space is cheap. Easy to save things. With services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon's S3</a> it may become easy to save every site you visit, etc. How to deal with so much data.</li>
<li>Once everything is saved search turns into personal archaeology. Parallels were made to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364343/">The Final Cut</a></li>
<li>Saving is easier. No more clipping out articles. Email a link. Bookmark to del.icio.us. A possible reason for increased packratting. Before I had to decide if something was worth bookmarking. Now it gets bookmarked if it's even remotely useful. Building a personal web.</li>
<li>Personal Organization. Easier than ever with things like folksonomies. Less rigid and quicker. Work currently be done on filesystems with similar organization structures. How will this affect digital lifestyles?</li>
<li>Search is King. Why organize when everything is a Spotlight/GoogleDesktop search away? Is this bad?</li>
<li>People can be even more anal (sorry ed) though if they choose to be. Flexibility is Queen.</li>
<li>GoogleZon. The move to digital lifestyles. <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/epic">EPIC 2015</a></li>
</ul>
