title: Microformats and Standardized Markup

<p>Quite some time ago there was discussion on many web development sites on standardizing various forms of markup. One thing that has come about are <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards. Instead of throwing away what works today, microformats intend to solve simpler problems first by adapting to current behaviors and usage patterns (e.g. XHTML, blogging).</blockquote>

<p>In essence it is just xhtml markup standardized so that it can be easily parsed. Most likely you've already used some such as rel="tag" for your tags. If you read my <a href="http://ebybox.aresgate.net/blog/archives/getting-things-done/">Getting Things Done post</a> then you may have noticed that my book review also had special markup. This markup is the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview">hReview</a> format.</p>

<p>The power of these formats are more apparent when you see some of the applications. For example <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">you can use a XSLT file</a> to transform <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCards</a> into their respective iCalendar/vCard formats which then can be used with your favorite desktop app. Some popular sites such as <a href="http://odeo.com">Odeo</a> and <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming.org</a> already use microformats. <a href="http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/geekery/greasemonkey_and_microformats.php">With a handy greasemonkey script</a> you can easily subscribe to events on any site that uses the format. Some example sites are <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/holidays/">Lesser Known Holidays</a> and even a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/gnomecal.html">conference schedule</a>. If your designing a site for an upcoming conference you might want to think about using such formats to help people reuse your data. To get an idea of what is really possible then you should take a look at <a href="http://www.mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-August/004738.html">MagicLine</a> for greasemonkey which takes advantage of these formats to create a searchable cache of information.</p>

<p>The possible uses of this in library land are already coming up such as the <a href="http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> and OpenURL as <a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2005/07/microformats_an.html">discussed on Outgoing</a>. If your redesigning your library website you might also look into using microformats for your event list or even your contact information so people can easily download it. Just one more way of easily pushing services.</p>
