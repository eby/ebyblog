From <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/78115371/stars">stevenf</a>:

<blockquote>As soon as an app has been rated more than once, it becomes mathematically very unlikely that it will ever see a 1 or 5 star overall rating again. So, it's nearly pointless to have scales of 5 stars, 10 stars, or 100 stars, when all you really need is: "Liked it, Didn't Like It, and Neutral".</blockquote>
