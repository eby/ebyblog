<blockquote><a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/01/07/folksonomies_controlled_vocabularies.php">Many-to-Many: folksonomies +  controlled vocabularies</a>
The advantage of folksonomies isn%u2019t that they're better than controlled vocabularies, it's that they're better than nothing, because controlled vocabularies are not extensible to the majority of cases where tagging is needed. Building, maintaining, and enforcing a controlled vocabulary is, relative to folksonomies, enormously expensive, both in the development time, and in the cost to the user, especailly the amateur user, in using the system.</blockquote>
