A sort of informal book club it taking shape. From <a href="http://code4lib.org/bookclub">the code4lib post</a>:

<blockquote>So a bunch of us in #code4lib are thinking of starting up a book club to read tech books together, learn from each other in the process, and hopefully use a bit of peer pressure to propel ourselves into actually finishing a book. 

The first book we're proposing we read is Practical Common Lisp which is available in print and also online. Lisp and functional languages in general are enjoying a bit of a renaissance at the moment, so we figured this might be a good one to start with. It's also very, umm, practical--building working code to parse ID3 tags (metadata!) and the like.</blockquote>

We're currently <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/books4code">using a Google Group for it</a>. Feel free to join.
