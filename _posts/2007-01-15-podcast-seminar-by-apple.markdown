Not sure how old this is but Apple offers a free on-demand seminar called <a href="http://seminars.apple.com/seminarsonline/podcast/apple/index.html?s=203">The Podcast Recipe: Producing a successful show</a>.

<blockquote>Podcasting is one of the most explosive technologies to hit the Internet. And with literally thousands of podcasts available on Apple iTunes, the need for high-quality production is critical. In this free, on-demand, three-part seminar Apple experts take you behind the scenes to see what it takes to perform a great-sounding podcast, produce a professional show, and promote a podcast to reach as many people as possible.</blockquote>

Obviously slanted towards Apple software but may be useful to some.
