I can't say I've wrapped my mind around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL">OpenURLs</a>. I picked up some understanding at code4lib but haven't had time to actually play around with things. There have been a couple recent posts by <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/staff/young.htm">Jeff Young</a> of OCLC that are worth a read though:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2006/06/openurl_the_min.html">OpenURL: The Ministry of Silly Names</a></li>
<li><a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2006/06/blind_as_a_bat.html">Blind as a bat</a></li>
<li><a href="http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2006/03/openurl_10_for_.html">OpenURL 1.0 for Reptilian Brains</a></li>
</ul>

There's also an idiots guide:

</ul>
