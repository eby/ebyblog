One of the problems with comments is that you lose track of the ones you make. I usually end up googling my name with various keywords to try to find them. I've also thought about using bookmarking services or some sort of other software hack to track them. A new service coming out <a href="http://www.cocomment.com/learnmore">called coComment</a> hopes to solve that problem. Using a bookmark from the site it keeps a copy of the comments you make. It's currently in beta so I'm not completely sure how it works. If it submits the comment on your behalf I think it might fail due to increased anti-spam measures. Will be interesting to see how it stands up.
