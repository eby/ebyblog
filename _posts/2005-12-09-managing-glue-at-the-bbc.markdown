I can't seem to find the link but there have been multiple usability reports that state the worst thing you can do is make your site look like your organizations org chart. The BBC with all their constant updated content also has this problem. So how do they keep it usable by normal users?

<blockquote>So I want to talk about 3 things that the BBC does centrally to try and make this easier for the end user - navigation, search, and classification.</blockquote>

A good article for anyone that is building large complex sites. Or anyone who has to deal with a site that is updated by multiple departments with various responsibilities. Your library may be in this boat.

I recommend giving it a read:  <a href="http://www.currybet.net/articles/glue/" title="Managing 'Glue' at the BBC - Martin Belam - IBERSID 2005 - currybetdotnet article">Managing 'Glue' at the BBC - Martin Belam - IBERSID 2005 - currybetdotnet article</a>
