Over at <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity</a> there is the beginnings of a series on collective choice which includes voting systems and user ranking/rating. These are more in depth articles on problems and design of such systems and how the various system types work. I recommend giving them a read if you have any interest in ranking or rating by users.
