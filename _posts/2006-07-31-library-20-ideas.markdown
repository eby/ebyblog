Dave Pattern has created <a href="http://www.daveyp.com/blog/index.php/archives/106/">The Library 2.0 Idea Generator</a>. There's a similar function in <a href="http://code4lib.org">#code4lib</a> where panizzi will generate ideas based on jargon. The command is @library2. A little more on the tongue-in-cheek side than Pattern's. Here are some examples:

<ul>
<li>Deleenolib = rss-based wiki via XML redirecting ead</li>
<li>Meebelidoolib = community shopping via email invite *only* integrating ontologies</li>
<li>Deloodoolib = cellphone-based news via email invite *only* revamping marc</li>
<li>Zimelibolib = geotag-based wiki via email invite *only* revamping ead</li>
<li>Infsharelib = greasemonkey extension for search engine via bittorrent revamping call numbers</li>
</ul>

Panizzi isn't the best with grammar.
