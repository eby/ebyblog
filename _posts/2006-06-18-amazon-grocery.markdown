Not sure how long ago it came about but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sd_allcatpop_gro/102-4065329-8012962?node=16310101">Amazon has a Grocery area</a> in beta with non-perishable items. It appears that a good chunk are organic or specialty items (almost 300 gluten-free items). I'm uncertain of how competitive their prices are. They do seem to have some bundle deals.

One of the new features: Shopping List. It allows you to keep track of things you buy routinely so you can order them all with ease.

<blockquote>At Amazon Grocery, you'll find longtime staples, from Kellogg's to Jiffy Pop. You'll find new entries, such as Kashi cereals and Kraft Easy Mac microwavable snack packets. And when we carry a brand, we'll try to carry every flavor available: not just the most popular flavors of Jell-O, but all flavors, from apricot to wild strawberry and the 70 flavors in-between. We're also making regional favorites like Andy Capp Hot Fries available nationwide, and making hard-to-find specialties like Zico Pure Coconut Water a standard part of our mix.</blockquote>

And for the ngc4lib'ers, no you do not now need to offer groceries at your library. ;-)
