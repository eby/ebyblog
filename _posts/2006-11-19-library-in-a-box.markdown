Nice post over on Beth's blog <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/?p=51">about a library in a box idea</a> (and not the closed black boxes some libraries buy):

<blockquote>Library-in-a-box is coming at these problems from several directions. One goal, for example, is to make an easily distributable CD (it could be distributed, for example, in a box!) that can install Evergreen or Koha and all their prerequisites, possibly as part of a customized linux distribution. We want to follow the example set by the Tactical Technology Collective (TTC) with their NGO-in-a-Box product.</blockquote>

She also discusses holding "source camps" that people could attend and learn the skills they need to support their local open-source tools. Definitely some worthwhile ideas in any region of the world.
