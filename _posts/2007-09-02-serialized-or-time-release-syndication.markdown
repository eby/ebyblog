The <a href="http://librarianinblack.typepad.com/librarianinblack/2007/08/rss-response-au.html">Librarian in Black has a post about a service that provides time-released RSS</a> which they call AutoResponder. The price seems a bit steep but it is centered towards business.

<blockquote>A number of potential uses are listed on the service's website, some of which might be useful for libraries: delivering a training course one chunk at a time, a series of photographs or historical documents, or a series of podcasts.</blockquote>

The idea has been around for awhile and the first major use I saw was the delivery of book chapters over time. <a href="http://www.surfarama.com/index.php?p=242">One example is Cory Doctorow's Someone comes to Town, Someone leaves Town</a>.

<blockquote>...doesn't matter when you first subscribe, this feed will deliver the book to your feed reader in the right order, a couple of chapters a day, over the next month.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.feedhoster.com/">Feed Hoster</a> is the hosting provider for the feed, who offers serialized options. Another interesting example is that of <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/">Light Cone</a> which uses data from <a href="http://www.anzwers.org/free/universe/">An Atlas of the Universe</a> and gives you a personal rss feed about what stars and objects light has passed since your birth.

<blockquote>Chi Draconis is 26.3 light years from Earth. It was enveloped by your light cone 3 weeks ago.</blockquote>

FeedCycle provides <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/tag/gutenberg/">serialized feeds for Project Gutenberg texts</a>. They also <a href="http://www.feedcycle.com/features.php">provide a free plan</a> which may be usable for some library experiments.

For the homegrown solution there are a few options which include using <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008220.html">id's and other options in the url string</a> or using <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/20/time-release-syndication">redirects and timestamps</a>. The latter has some potential problems with aggregator support and shared aggregators.

Something to think about.
