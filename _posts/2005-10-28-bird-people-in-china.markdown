Well if there's one good thing about the recent slump in decent offerings from Holly wood it's my reintroduction to quality cinema from other countries. I know some people hate subtitles but your really short changing yourself if your not seeing some of these movies. I glad the US has imported some recently (Hero, etc) instead of just making shitty remakes. If you've seen the remakes you should really see the original. Here are some I recommend checking out, some are old, some are newer:

<ul>
<li>Amelie</li>
<li>Tale of Two Sisters</li>
<li>Battle Royale</li>
<li>Barbarian Invasions</li>
<li>City of Lost Children</li>
<li>Good Bye Lenin</li>
<li>Oldboy</li>
<li>3-Iron</li>
<li>City of God</li>
</ul>

You can find these and more <a href="http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=6481314">on my IMDB vote list</a>. There's also plenty of good independent movies in the US that came out.

The movie I watched most recently is called "The Bird People in China" which is kindof a story of old meets new, business vs old way of life, etc. I was really expecting a drama, but as in most foriegn films it's hard to categorize. There is drama, humor, etc. There were a couple scenes that caught me and I did some screenshots. The quality of the photography is much better than these screens show, I saved them as lower quality for the web and had my gamma slightly higher on that computer so it's a bit dark. I really recommend checking this out. It's <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?trkid=73&movieid=70027369">available at NetFlix</a>.
