An <a href="http://www.jackslocum.com/yui/2006/10/09/my-wordpress-comments-system-built-with-yahoo-ui-and-yahooext/">interesting comment system over at Jack Slocum's blog that uses the Yahoo UI kit with Wordpress</a>. It allows you to comment on any "block" which includes paragraphs, headings, images, etc.

I've seen this done in other systems but I do like how it's handled here. A similar interface was thrown around for commenting on articles in public access journals and possibly a code4lib journal if it ever occurs. Would be a nice addition to some of the Open Journal System layouts. Would also possible be good for repositories.
