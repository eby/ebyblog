From <a href="http://christinaslibraryrant.blogspot.com/2007/01/flabbergasted-springerlink-has-google.html">over at Christina's LIS Rant</a>:

<blockquote>Flabbergasted: Springerlink has Google ads!.....So apparently charging us $1-10k per journal isn't enough. I am absolutely amazed, flabbergasted, and well, horrified. Are they trying to prove that we're putting them out of business with our open access (tongue in cheek), we evil librarians?</blockquote>

The google ad's are on the item view screen. I'm actually not surprised as the pages are <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22Multiobjective+structural+optimization+using+a+microgenetic+algorithm%22&btnG=Search">accessible from Google Scholar</a>. I expect more to go this route as they make landing pages for the various open search engines.

This does make me wonder though. Will vendors continue with the subscription model or move towards a pay-per-view only model since they already have it for search engines in the future and can probably make more money? Will a search engine convince some of them to end the subscriptions and subsidize the change in order to try to pull more people into using their product instead of libraries? Will Google integrate Google Checkout with Scholar for easy shopping or perhaps personal subscriptions? I think there are quite a few business possibilities and libraries aren't necessarily in the picture. I think that concerns me more.
