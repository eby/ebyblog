A drupal-based digital library CMS is <a href="http://dlcms.interoperating.info/">available as a prototype</a>. Has some potential of a low barrier for use.

<blockquote>There appears to be very few general-purpose, open-source digital library collection management systems. Applications such as DSpace and MDID are vertical, in the sense that they are optimized for a specific audience or type of document. Generalized repository platforms such as Fedora may be overkill for libraries that want to publish a collection of material quickly and without having to develop their own application layer on top of the repository platform or from scratch.</blockquote>
