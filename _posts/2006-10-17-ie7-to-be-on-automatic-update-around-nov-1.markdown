Something to watch out for with resources. Users will have the option of not installing it. From <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/updatemanagement/windowsupdate/ie7announcement.mspx">the announcement</a>:

<blockquote>To help customers become more secure and up-to-date, Microsoft will distribute Internet Explorer 7 as a high-priority update via Automatic Updates and the Windows Update and Microsoft Update sites. Internet Explorer 7 will be available for users of genuine Windows XP SP2, Windows XP 64-bit Edition, and Windows Server 2003 SP1.

This announcement provides an overview of the delivery process and options available to IT Administrators to prevent delivery of Internet Explorer 7 to their organization through Automatic Updates. Customers wishing to block the delivery of Internet Explorer 7 into their organization should have blocking measures complete by November 1. Distribution of Internet Explore 7 by Automatic Updates will take several months to complete. Microsoft will revise this announcement with more information in the future.

....

Note   If a user has installed Internet Explorer 7 and subsequently removes it, Automatic Updates will re-offer Internet Explorer 7 to that machine using the process above in order to bring it up to date. In this case, a user need only select the "don't install" option at the welcome screen. Internet Explorer 7 will no longer be presented by Automatic Updates.</blockquote>
