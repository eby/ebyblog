<blockquote>"It may be time to consider the possibility that young people who behave as if privacy doesn't exist are actually the sane people, not the insane ones... the idea of a truly private life is already an illusion. Every street in New York has a surveillance camera. Each time you swipe your debit card at Duane Reade or use your MetroCard, that transaction is tracked. Your employer owns your e-mails. The NSA owns your phone calls. Your life is being lived in public whether you choose to acknowledge it or not... it's the extreme caution of the earlier generation that's the narcissistic thing."</blockquote>
