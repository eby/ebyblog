If you enjoy photography and have taken some portraits then you may want to send them to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/artmatters">In Your Face flickr group</a>. From the intro page:

<blockquote><p>Also, for the first time in the history of the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Gallery is launching an exhibition created entirely by the public. The exhibition, called In Your Face, opens July 1, 2006.  One of the AGO's initiatives as part of Toronto's Live with Culture celebration this year, In Your Face will allow everyone to become a creative part of the Gallery's future. </p>

<p>Portraits submitted to this Flickr group may be included in a computer kiosk slideshow presentation coinciding with the In Your Face exhibit at the AGO this summer starting July 1. There will not be any physical prints made of the Flickr group portrait submissions. A Flickr photostream will also be incorporated into the AGO's web site at www.ago.net. </p></blockquote>
