Vendor lock-in, lack of customization and other problems are present in many software categories. There may be a solution though, for those that can't switch providers. As you probably know <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> allows users to fix or alter sites as they need to. This is nice but requires the user to have Firefox and the program installed. It is also a poweruser type of use.

But now there's a server-side solution that takes the example of GreaseMonkey and moves it to the server side. Now you can alter what people see without altering their browsers or the underlying web application itself. No small task but may be a solution for some out there trying to implement some changes that are just not possible within the web-app itself. Take a look:

<blockquote> Monkeygrease is a very simple servlet filter that will allow a web developer to inject JavaScript, CSS or other elements within a web page.</blockquote>
