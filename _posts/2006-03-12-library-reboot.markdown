In the theme of looking outside the library world for ideas, are any libraries taking part in <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com/">CSS Reboot on May 1st</a>? I've seen a lot of people working on redesigns (who isn't) but not sure if I've seen any state they were doing something like this. A way to get your name and site out there. That is presuming your using CSS which you probably should be. There's still time left to freshen your site up and make it more standards-based (and I don't mean marc).
