A newish search engine that hopes to make a more personized search and make things more relevant by only searching the "active web". Centered towards research and some discovery it seems though probably helps with hot topics. Also keeps search history, etc.

Expect similar services from the major search engines in the future. Google and Yahoo have large amounts of data and it only makes sense to use it to personalize the results. There will be privacy concerns so the debates will likely be illuminating. 

If you want the perfect search though, it's something that's needed. I expect this sort of thing to become more prevalent in library settings as well. There are already talks of how to use the data we have to improve the search.
