<p>XMLHttpRequest is becoming a powerful tool. Used in Javascript to get data from the server without a page refresh, it's power can be seen in tools such as <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a>. Before there was Google Suggest there was LiveSearch which many people have implemented in their blogs. Here's some sites that may help explain how to use it better:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">Dynamic HTML and XML: The XMLHttpRequest Object</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a></li>

<li><a href="http://blog4.bitflux.ch/wiki/LiveSearch">LiveSearch Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the code at most of these places in PHP so it's easy to integrate with Library sites or other projects. A nice way to help people get suggested search terms. I'm trying to find a good thesaurus for a similar project. More later.</p>
