This presentation was done by <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/">Karen Schneider</a> which was done virtually and was about the <a href="http://lii.org/">Librarian's Internet Index</a>. I've been hoping to see Karen present and this was another reason to go. The presentation focused on the change of LII to Lucene which is still forthcoming. Some notes:

<ul>
<li>Users expect full text search</li>
<li>Most don't use boolean (including librarians)</li>
<li>Most don't do boolean well (including librarians)</li>
<li>Quite a few use quoted searches</li>
<li>Very few use advanced search (including librarians) and those that do usually use it as a help page to see what can be searched</li>
<li>White space can help with results</li>
<li>Dropped LCSH - most was used poorly</li>
<li>In testing search engines reused actual search queries of various types (boolean, misspellings, simple, advanced)</li>
<li>Always test a non-beta version of vendor software</li>
<li>Use testers only once - tainted from then on</li>
<li>Turn off rank number - just confuses - relevant results should be at top, doesn't matter what number you assign</li>
<li>Faceted search is useful</li>
<li>Keeping browse and search together was a major driver for the change in search technology</li>
</ul>

While my notes are short it was a worthwhile presentation, especially if you were doing testing of products. The upcoming LII looked quite nice and they went with a commercial product built on Lucene rather then roll their own which was a nice difference from the other presenters. I'd post a screenshot but I think they may prefer I not until it goes live. It does look like a nice change, though.
