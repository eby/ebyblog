ScienceBlogs <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/challenge/">held a challenge</a> for bloggers to complete a SAT style writing assignment in the allotted timeframe. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2006/10/the_sat_challenge_the_essays_h.php">The results were rather low compared to high school students</a>.

<blockquote>Well, 500 people looked at the essay question, but just 109 were able to complete a scoreable response under the time limit. That alone should demonstrate that the SAT challenge was no easy task. But what about the responses? Can seasoned bloggers do better than high schoolers?</blockquote>
