Leaving the ILS vendors out of this one. You may have noticed that the <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/">Simile</a> people made a modified dump of their catalog available as a data set in RDF, MODs, etc. There's quite a few people in code4lib that are doing experiments with library data and who also believe in the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data">Open Data</a>, so <a href="http://code4lib.org/node/116">torrents were made</a> to help share the information.

Well fast forward and the dump has been removed with the reason of "<a href="http://simile.mit.edu/rdf-test-data/barton/README.txt">We are currently evaluating legal issues about ownership and licensing possibilities and hope to be able to be back online with it soon.</a>". Due to this the tracker for the torrents was also shut down.

While nothing is known for sure the debate arose in #code4lib that this may be related to the lack of concrete information on who owns the records when 3rd party records are used such as OCLC's or LoC's. <a href="http://www.oclc.org/support/documentation/worldcat/records/guidelines/default.htm">OCLC has some guidelines up</a> but it was debated whether that was a legal license and it was also debated whether LoC is public data being a government entity. The only thing that was agreed on was that it would likely take better statements from the 3rd parties or a legal case to make those who work with this data feel safe.
