It appears that Firefox 2 will support OpenSearch for the search bar, similar to IE7. I think this will make things easier in the long-run. I just tried out the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2006/05/12/bon-echo-alpha-2-milestone/">Bon Echo Alpha 2</a> and it detects the OpenSearch correctly though it doesn't appear you can add it yet. There are a couple places to track progress though:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Search_Service">Search Service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Search_Service:Code_Design">Search Service:Code Design</a></li>
</ul>
