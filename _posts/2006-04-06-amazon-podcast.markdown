Well as they seem to jump on the new technologies I shouldn't be surprised that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/gss/detail/10840/104-2803323-0757519">Amazon now has a podcast</a>.

<blockquote>Welcome to Amazon Wire, an original, free podcast about books, music, movies, and those who create them. This show's segments include: An interview with director Steven Soderbergh of Traffic and Ocean's 11 fame on the recent release of his new film, Bubble. Two music interviews, one with Chris Stein from pop great and recent Rock & Roll Hall of Famers Blondie, plus Steven Drozd from indie favorite The Flaming Lips. An exclusive audio essay from Freakonomics author Stephen J. Dubner entitled "Teaching Monkeys to Use Money." </blockquote>
