Came across a <a href="http://www.relona.net/">new search engine</a>, though it's more of a technology preview. Has some interesting features though I'm unsure of their interface for them. It seems a bit confusing for me but with some interface work the features may be worthwhile. What they list:

<ul>
<li>Instant-Previews: Preview search results without opening windows.</li>
<li>Auto-Refine: Automatically disambiguate ambiguous queries.</li>
<li>IntelliBrowser: Seamlessly blend browsing and searching.</li>
<li>ResearchRank: A superior keyword search algorithm.</li>
<li>Power Leads: An efficient alternative to search-engine advertisements.</li>
<li>Perfect Search: A learning algorithm that converges toward near-perfect results.</li>
</ul>

I think I've seen other engines with similar things (previews, etc.) but am unsure. I found the intellibrowser interesting though.
