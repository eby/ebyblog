News to me but it looks like MS is coming out with a tool to help build e-learning modules (learning objects) named <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/Grava">Grava</a>. 

<blockquote>â€œGravaâ€ is the codename to a new set of tools from Microsoftâ€™s Education Product Group that will allow the education community to create and assemble materials that will increase discovery and allow learners to go at their own pace and learning style. Grava tools are slated for release in the Fall of 2007.</blockquote>

There's not much information on the site and I'm a little worried that there's no mention of any of the standards such as IMS, common cartridge, etc. Hopefully it's not just another format like most MS offerings though right now there doesn't seem to be a decent spec anyone wants to support anyways. It's really an area that could be improved.

There's some <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/Grava/content/content.aspx?ContentID=4259">screenshots of the interface</a>.
