<ul>
<li>New issure of Ariadne that includes <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue48/chudnov-et-al/">an Introduction to UnAPI</a> and an article on <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue48/dempsey/">library catalogs and discovery</a>.</li>
<li>Google Book search <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/finding-wealth-in-your-library-and.html">has added library catalog search</a>. Most of the hits I got were OpenWorldCat. Similar to what I was hoping the "find in libraries" was headed but plenty of room for improvement</li>
<li><a href="http://ideaconference.org/index.html">IDEA 2006 is taking shape</a> and will be hosted at the Seattle Public Library. Their site states its about "how to let everyday people take true advantage of the overwhelming mass of information that floods their lives." Some library related people are involved.</li>
</ul>
