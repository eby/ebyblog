<p>Got the video ipod at work the other day. Some departments on campus are considering podcasting. I'll post more ideas and details later but here's a quick review.<br />
<br />
I have to say that the screen is damn near amazing. The colors and quality are top of the line, what I would expect from Apple screens. The photo above does not do anything close to justice to the image. I watched a music video and an episode of Lost and had no problems viewing it. The screen is find for the size though watching something that's subtitled may be iffy. I'll have to try it out when I get the chance.<br />
<br />
The USB only is still a killer for me so I'm uncertain if I will purchase one myself (plus old iPod still works). I hooked it to my laptop and it took damn near forever to get a show on there. If I get the 60gig though I can fit my entire library on it so once it's updated there won't be much to keep it going.<br />
<br />
More ideas on it's use later.</p>
