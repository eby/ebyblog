Came across this <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/10/circulating_map.html">via SuperPatron</a>. It looks like <a href="http://www.aadl.org/node/2388">AADL lends out street maps</a> for people that are going on vacations and the like. I think this is an interesting service as a lot of times it's a waste for someone to buy a map when they will only be there for a few days. Could also probably ask for donations from those who have. Probably fairly cheap for the gas station type ones compared to USGS.

I believe my library is non-circulating for all of the maps. At least the website gives that impression.
