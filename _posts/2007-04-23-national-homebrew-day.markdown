If you didn't know May 5th this year is <a href="http://www.beertown.org/events/bigbrew/index.html">National Homebrew Day</a>, also known as Big Brew. It is actually a holiday recognized by congress, despite some states still being a little anti-homebrewing. Many clubs and breweries organize brewing demonstrations with the nationally chosen recipes. There is also a simultaneous toast at noon Central Time, though I think we missed the timing last year with all the brewing going on. 

If your interested check out if there is a <a href="http://www.beertown.org/events/bigbrew/Bigbrewselect.aspx">location near you</a> (warning: interface is not very usable). Here's a flyer I threw together for my club's big brew:

There's some more info at a <a href="http://www.thefirkins.com/events/big-brew/">half-assed attempt at a site for my club</a>. I need to put some more time into it. Here's some photos from last year's event:
