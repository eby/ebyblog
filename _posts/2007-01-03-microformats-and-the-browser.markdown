In case you missed it from my linklog, there's a nice series of posts over at Alex Faaborg's blog about microformats and the reasoning behind a new extension called Operator. The posts:

<h4><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2006/12/11/microformats-part-0-introduction">Microformats - Part 0: Introduction</a></h4>

An introduction to microformats and some related links. Also some information on why they are useful.

<blockquote>ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what microformats are, adding semantics to markup to take it from being machine readable to being machine understandable.</blockquote>

<h4><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2006/12/12/microformats-part-1-structured-data-chaos">Microformats - Part 1: Structured Data Chaos</a></h4>

Discusses one of the problems with RSS: lots of labels and buttons, and the eventual change with browsers agreeing on a set of icons. Right now other data such as events and contact information also has this problem:

<blockquote>This is a problem that only the browser can solve. Just like with RSS, it is time for Web browsers to provide the user with a clean, consistent, and simplistic user interface.</blockquote>

<h4><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2006/12/13/microformats-part-2-the-fundamental-types">Microformats - Part 2: The Fundamental Types</a></h4>

What formats should be supported and how they are connected.

<blockquote>Detecting information in Web pages and handing that information off to other applications changes the role of the Web browser from being solely a HTML renderer to being an information broker. </blockquote>

<h4><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2006/12/16/microformats-part-3-introducing-operator">Microformats - Part 3: Introducing Operator</a></h4>

<blockquote>Today Mozilla Labs is releasing Operator, a microformat detection extension developed by Michael Kaply at IBM. Operator demonstrates the usefulness of semantic information on the Web, in real world scenarios.</blockquote>
