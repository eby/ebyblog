Another <a href="http://blog.ruhlman.com/2007/02/guest_blogging_.html">humorous essay on the food network</a>:

<blockquote>Where the saintly Julia Child sought to raise expectations, to enlighten us, make us better--teach us--and in fact, did, Rachael uses her strange and terrible powers to narcotize her public with her hypnotic mantra of Yummo and Evoo and Sammys. "Youâ€™re doing just fine. You donâ€™t even have to chop an onion--you can buy it already chopped. Aspire to nothingâ€¦Just sit there. Have another Triscuitâ€¦Sleepâ€¦.sleepâ€¦."</blockquote>
