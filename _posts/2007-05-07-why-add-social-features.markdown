Via <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/why-invest-in-social-features/">the Bokardo blog</a>:

<blockquote>I think that social features are bigger than many people view them. They are a long-term strategy that takes lots of resources. You can't simply bolt on a feature here or there (well, unless it's article sharing or something super simple like that) and expect to realize the benefits of making a richer social experience for your users.</blockquote>

The <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/05/01/why-invest-in-social-features-for-your-web-site/">article he wrote on Brain Sparks</a> talks about some of the benefits that include more data and trust.

<blockquote>Perhaps the least talked about benefit of social features is that they are wonderful precursors to a data-driven design strategy. Every time someone saves, shares, or comments on something, you have more data to go on regarding what they find valuable.</blockquote>

I think there's a lot of room for experimentation with social features but you need to have some ideas and research behind it. I've seen quite a few just add a feature because they could. I think Beth Jefferson and the <a href="http://bibliocommons.com/">BiblioCommons</a> crew have put in quite a bit of research and I'm interested in seeing how it pans out. There's a lot of things they could have done but when talking with her about the work she's doing you can tell that everything you see has a purpose and data behind the decision.

I do look forward to more data, presuming it's usable and shareable.
