Still bogged down in beginning of semester problems but I'm hopeful to get some posts up soon.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/24.html#a1513">Jon Udell has a screen cast showing Amazon EC2 in use</a>. I've read about some of the research labs and other people who are putting EC2 to use and I think there is a lot of potential. You no longer need to invest in a lot of hardware for periodic intensive programs. As I see more libraries moving to heavier indexing and text analysis, I can see EC2 coming in handy and keeping things cheap. Someone can experiment with cluster level operations without the large investment. This is something to watch.</li>
<li>Yahoo is finally doing some integration with their purchases. <a href="http://flickr.com/map/">Flickr now has Yahoo Map integration</a> and <a href="http://upcoming.org/">Upcoming.org</a> has added quite a few things including flickr photo integration.</li>
<li>There's an <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/MT/archives/000119.php">article at UX Matters about data tables</a> that goes over common practices regarding filter placement and sorting options. Worth a read.</li>
<li><a href="http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/archives/2006/09/03/zotero">via darcusblog</a> there's an update to the Firefox Scholar extension which is now called <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>. From the site it looks like it definitely has some potential.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/geeks/episode/003-the-thing-you-do">third episode of Library Geeks is out</a>. This one focuses on LibraryThing which I've been playing with somewhat lately.</li>
<li>It's apparently already the <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/10years.html">10th year anniversary of Homestar Runner</a>. Hard to believe.</li>
<li><a href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/?p=76">via Dave's Educational Blog</a>, the "<a href="http://www.ithaka.org/strategic-services/oss/OOSS_Report_FINAL.pdf">Open Source in Higher Ed - The Courant Report</a> (pdf)" has been made available. Haven't had time to read but plan on doing so.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.unto.net/miscellaneous/introducing-opensearchorg/">via DeWitt Clinton</a> it seems OpenSearch community has a new home at <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/">opensearch.org</a> which includes the spec, a mailing list and more.</li>
<li>And finally the <a href="http://acrlblog.org/2006/09/05/gaining-the-trust-of-students/">ACRLog points out</a> that it shouldn't be assumed that students will trust librarians just because they're librarians. Also check out the comments.</li>
</ul>
