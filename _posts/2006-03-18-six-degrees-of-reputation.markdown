<a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/">First Monday</a> often has interesting content though I rarely get around to reading it as much as I should. Currently they are running a <a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_3/david/index.html">piece on reputation and the problems that arise with such systems</a>. The abstract:

<blockquote>We explore several cases in which book and CD reviews were copied whole or in part from one item to another and show that hundreds of product reviews on Amazon.com might be copies of one another. We further explain the strategies involved in these suspect product reviews, and the ways in which the collapse of the barriers between authors and readers affect the ways in which these information goods are being produced and exchanged. We report on techniques that are employed by authors, artists, editors, and readers to ensure they promote their agendas while they build their identities as experts. We suggest a framework for discussing the changes of the categories of authorship, creativity, expertise, and reputation that are being reÃ¢â‚¬â€œnegotiated in this multiÃ¢â‚¬â€œtier reputation economy.</blockquote>
