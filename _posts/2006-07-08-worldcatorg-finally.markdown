One of the major shortcomings in my mind of OpenWorldCat was that it was difficult to search it unless you knew all the special words you needed. It looks like they are <a href="http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/dotorg/default.htm">finally coming out with the central homepage</a> that I think will hopefully help it's use. Better search engine inclusion would still be nice. I'd also like to see a decent API for participating libraries to integrate some of the features in local catalogs.
