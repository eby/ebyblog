Another old post that is worth reading <a href="http://blog.threepress.org/2009/02/21/a-case-study-in-converting-image-based-ebooks-into-xml/">over at threepress about a case study in ebook presentation</a> that has obvious application to scanning projects.

Most of the findings line up with experience but nice to see them quantified. Many preferred html versions for printability, layout, etc. Also covers workflow, costs.
