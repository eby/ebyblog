title: Worx Powershare Chainsaw Doesn't Start

I have a Nitro 40v Powershare Worx Chainsaw I use for some mild work around the yard each spring. When I got it out for this year it wouldn't start.

### Symptoms

- Batteries are fully charged. Chainsaw shows full battery.
- Press the button to start and get one blinking green light.

## Diagnosis

It is buried in the troubleshooting docs, but a blinking single green light is the safety mechanism alert, not a 'not enough power' alert.

To clear it you need to pull the hand guard all the way back toward the batteries until it clicks. Then it will go back to the original position. 

I think the plastic is slightly bent on mine so I had to really push it back with the plastic pushing against the handle to get it to click.

Once clicked it was fully operational.
