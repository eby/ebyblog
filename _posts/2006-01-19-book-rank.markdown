An interesting idea:

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Take a single book from Amazon as a root. </li>
<li>Take the recommended books for that book.</li>
<li>Repeat until you have reached a distance of 20 from the original book.</li>
<li>Add up the number of recommendations for each book.</li>
<li>Calculate the BookRank from the Distance, Recommendations and SalesRank</li>
<li>Display the 250 books with the highest BookRank.</li>

</ol></blockquote>
