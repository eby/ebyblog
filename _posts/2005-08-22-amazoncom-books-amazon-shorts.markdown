With all the recent hubbub over Google Print, here's a company that gets it. Sell short exclusive works for cheap since there are almost no distribution costs.

Amazon.com Books: Amazon Shorts</a>

Update: A author <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003681.html">discusses the program</a>. More discussion in the comments of the post as well.
