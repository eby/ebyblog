<a href="http://techessence.info/node/83">From Roy Tennant</a>:

<blockquote>So what should you do? I'm sorry, but you get paid a lot of money to figure that out, so you can hardly expect me to give it away for free. But it may be sufficient to say that you can't simply provide incremental changes to your legacy code. You need to think strategically and invest in some serious re-engineering. You need to be thinking imaginatively and innovating like your life depends on it. Oh, oops, it does. Silly me.</blockquote>
