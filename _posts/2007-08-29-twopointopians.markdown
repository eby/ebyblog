A <a href="http://annoyedlibrarian.blogspot.com/2007/08/cult-of-twopointopia.html">post worth reading over at Annoyed Librarian</a>. She does seem annoyed:

<blockquote>But the twopointopians definitely do. For them, disagreement lets them show how self-righteous and "user-centered" they are, while showing how clueless and selfish everyone else is. You see, the twopointopians "get it," while the rest of us just don't understand. They're like religious converts preaching the gospel of 2.0 to everyone, and they just can't understand either that nobody cares, or that everyone already knows about it.</blockquote>

The comments seemed to deteriorate quickly, though they are also worth reading:

<blockquote>...You annonymous commenters - instead of calling 2.0 speakers and bloggers fascists... why not add something constructive to the conversation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yo, David Lee Roth, aren't you out on tour this summer?</blockquote>
