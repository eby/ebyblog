One of the big projects I'm finally working on is documenting more of the systems I work on. It is an overwhelming project but I try to remember to start small.

> Writing small docs isn’t just about reducing word count, it’s about focusing your ideas, streamlining collaboration, and creating a better experience for reviewers (and for you, in the long run). While it takes practice to break down big ideas into smaller parts, the effort pays off in faster reviews, clearer communication, and less stress.
