The web is <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2005/09/yahoo_launches_.html">abuzz with the new Yahoo mail</a>. Looks like a very nice implementation of a email application online. I'll stick with gmail since my yahoo account was closed due to the amount of spam I was getting. I have an inkling that yahoo was behind some of it. I also prefer the label approach over folders. It was the main reason I moved to Gmail.

I do wish that Microsoft would do something about the webmail interface for Exchange servers. We have one at work and it sucks if you use anything other than IE. They even make it so you can't set preferences unless your using IE. That is just retarded.

If you like some of the features of the yahoo mail such as drag-and-drop and have access to an IMAP server then you might want to install <a href="http://www.roundcube.net/">RoundCube Webmail</a> on a server and try it out. I used it to access the exchange server via IMAP and it worked great. Has some CSS issues with Safari and I can't seem to figure out how to connect to a IMAP that requires SSL but the planned features are impressive. Plus it's opensource.

It's really interesting to see how many of the interface elements that were relegated to the desktop be implemented in browsers on the web.
