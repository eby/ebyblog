I've <a href="http://libdev.plymouth.edu/post/18">posted over at LibDev regarding standards in library systems</a>. I'll probably be posting some more over there though I'll try to keep my rants here. Having mostly worked with open-source and similar formats it feels strange going into a world of vendor lockin and custom formats. It's nice to see others are experiencing the same and trying to work around it.

I recommend checking out <a href="http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/">darcusblog</a> as there's been quite a few interesting posts regarding formats. Also <a href="http://daweed.blogspot.com/2005/10/il05-day-3-web-winners-john-blyberg.html">check out the overview</a> of <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/">John Blyberg's</a> presentation from IL2005 at <a href="http://daweed.blogspot.com/">dave's blog</a>. Goes over the use of open standards in <a href="http://aadl.org/">their new site</a> (which I really like) and how they modified the OPAC templates so they could integrate it better. If I find actual slides/handouts online I'll update with a link.
