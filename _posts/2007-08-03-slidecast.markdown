I missed it earlier but you now have the ability to sync audio with slides at slideshare. It's a nice addition for those who can do audio of presentations but not video for whatever reason. Here's the overview:

<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=82836&doc=slidecasting-1013073" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=82836&doc=slidecasting-1013073" /></object>
