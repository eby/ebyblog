<a href="http://dltj.org/2006/07/can-google-be-out-googled/">pmurray has an article on google, amazon and out-googling google</a>. It's worth a read if just to start a discussion.

<blockquote>Can we do it? As the lead (and perhaps only) cheerleader for the Out-Google Google thesis, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m starting to have my doubts. First came what looked like automated faceted analysis in Google. That turned out to be Google Co-op Health Ã¢â‚¬â€ a human-driven effort to add metadata to selected websites that appear in the search engine results. (By the wayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦why didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we [the library profession] think of that? And now that it has been thought of why arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we doing more with enlisting the aid of experts from their own field in categorizing their segment of the world of information?)</blockquote>
