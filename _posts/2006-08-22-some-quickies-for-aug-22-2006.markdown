<li>Joel of Joel on Software is <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/21.html">looking for software that will scan information off a book</a> and download Library of Congress info. He found a couple programs <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/22.html">but neither will print labels</a>. It's surprising there aren't more offerings with the large collections some people have. Would probably be a money saver for small libraries as well.</li>
<li>Jon Udell posts that <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/22.html">del.icio.us isn't simply backed by a database, it can function as a database</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/11420/">Casey discusses how easy it is to tweak the catalog</a> once you have a backend that's a bit more robust.</li>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2908621023073531157">What if drugs were legal?</a> (video) - <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/54110">via Metafilter</a></li>
<li>A <a href="Atom Publisher Protocol for WordPress">drop-in Atom Publisher Protocol for WordPress is taking shape</a>. The more I work with Atom the more I like it, though I haven't gotten the chance to play with APP yet. I'm doubtful I will ever produce flavors or RSS in the future. I've also been thinking of playing with Wordpress as an Atom store. There's some semantics in the Atom feed I don't really take advantage of, such as related links.</li>
