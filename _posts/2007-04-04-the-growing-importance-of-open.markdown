While I still haven't gotten time to fully grok dchud's <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/story/open-data-is-not-the-point">Open Data is not the point</a>, some more posts regarding the importance of open data have come about. While I agree with dchud that it's definitely not the whole story, it is an important one.

Alf over at Hublog posts some of the <a href="http://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/001466.html">replies he's gotten from services when trying to access his own data or aggregate data</a>. The general response is "sorry, that data is too valuable". Nothing surprising or new, though access to at least ones own data should be more acceptable.

Then there is a nice response to Dare's <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69141977-7514-443d-800b-1f95c1ff8dbe">Open Source is Dead</a>, titled <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2007/03/28/open-data-matters-more-than-open-source/">Open Data matters more than Open Source</a>.

<blockquote>Open Source will still matter, of course (especially for server-side work), but it wonâ€™t be an important battle ground any more. Until we can convince (or force) web sites to embrace and standardize on Open Data formats â€” XML, JSON, or even CSV, as appropriate â€” we will be in some ways even more locked in than we were in the bad old desktop days. Celebrate Open Sourceâ€™s victory, by all means, but get ready for an even bigger and bloodier battle over the next 10-20 years.</blockquote>

It's well worth reading the comments about the difference between server-side and client-side and the freedoms each allow. 

I'm still not at the point where I can probably write eloquently on the issue, but if you have the time I recommend reading the above and following links. 'Open' in any form is becoming more and more important whether it's source, data, access or identity.
