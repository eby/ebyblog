I'm sure everyone else already knows but Wordpress also moved to <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/">Subversion and Trac</a>. Fairly easy to keep track of development and bug fixes in my favorite blog/cms. If you haven't already check out <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/timeline">the timeline</a>. Might come in handy for those who are wondering if some bug is fixed already and most likely a diff if you want. Can also check out builds back to 1.5 not that you would want to. I've been very happy with the stability of the SVN branch of Gregarius but think I'll hold off on Wordpress since those sites are public.

I've already written about my love of subversion+trac <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/managing-my-web-projects/">in a previous post</a>
