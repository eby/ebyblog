<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/cryptographic_web_of_trust">Cryptographic Web of Trust</a> at The Sun BabelFish Blog:

<blockquote>What is needed is some way to increase the methods people can have to trust information I state. Here I describe how one can use cryptography to increase that trust level. Starting from my creation of a PGP key, I show how I can describe my public signature in my foaf file, used PGP to sign that file and then link to the signature so that people can detect a tampered file. From this basis I show how one can build a very solid cryptographically enhanced web of trust.</blockquote>
