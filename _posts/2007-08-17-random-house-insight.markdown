A <a href="http://www.randomhouse.biz/webservices/insight/">new API from random house to search book contents and retrieve digitized page views</a>. Looks potentially useful though I haven't checked out all of the terms:

<blockquote>Through the Insight Service, keyword searches can get inside actual book content and find matches against the full text of the book. Insight can then serve up the pages of the book in different formats depending on the needs of the developer: for example, pages can be displayed in high-quality image formats for optimal viewing or speedy little thumbnails for quick review.</blockquote>
