I pointed to the AOL data release in a previous post. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html?ex=1312776000&amp;en=f6f61949c6da4d38&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">New York Times uses it to track down a one of the searchers and discusses the problems with such data</a>. Worth a read.

<blockquote>And search by search, click by click, the identity of AOL user No. 4417749 became easier to discern. There are queries for Ã¢â‚¬Å“landscapers in Lilburn, Ga,Ã¢â‚¬Â several people with the last name Arnold and Ã¢â‚¬Å“homes sold in shadow lake subdivision gwinnett county georgia.Ã¢â‚¬Â

It did not take much investigating to follow that data trail to Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow who lives in Lilburn, Ga., frequently researches her friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ medical ailments and loves her three dogs. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Those are my searches,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said, after a reporter read part of the list to her.</blockquote>
