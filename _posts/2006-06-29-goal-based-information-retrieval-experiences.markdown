Relating to <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/the-flexible-opac/">my previous post on the importance of flexibility</a>, is <a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/information_architecture/goal_based_information_retrieval_experiences.html">this article on goal-based information retrieval</a> by Joe Lamantia. It's definitely worth a read.

<blockquote>A better way of framing information retrieval is in terms of opportunities to meet genuine user goals and objectives by supporting more varied modes of activity. Users often have broad goals in mind while they pursue information retrieval activities; buying a car, making a good investment decision, or learning how to manage their health care plans. And yet the information architecture of many environments still overemphasizes searching as a way of accomplishing goals.</blockquote>
