I <a href="http://blog.ryaneby.com/archives/google-subscribed-links/">posted previously about google co-op</a> and what it might allow. One of the things I wanted to do was get our e-resource listings augmented and put up. My hopes would be to get some of the quality journals and indexes assigned common keywords they might be associated with. <a href="http://www.patronizing.org/?p=8">Our programmer Josh apparently read my mind and got an initial version up</a>. It doesn't seem to bring stuff up for all subjects we have specified but it's a start. I had forgotten about research guides and it's good to see those come up on top. Lots of future possibilities for this. Here's a pic of what it looks like:

Some thoughts for the future:

<ul>
<li>tag resources with the various subjects they handle</li>
<li>Allow patron tagging of e-resources?? Use those as keywords for co-op?</li>
<li>Update links for ezproxy once it's ready</li>
<li>Look at common searches that are research related and build or tag guides?</li>
</ul>
