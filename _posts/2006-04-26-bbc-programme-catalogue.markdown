I thought I posted about it but can't seem to find it at the moment. There were <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000071.html">previous</a> blog <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2005/10/31/hot_bbc_archive_action.html">posts</a> giving some hints of what was to come. Ruby on Rails, RDF, REST, FOAF. <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/">A live version is now available</a>. Interesting if just to see a possible interface for a large dataset.
