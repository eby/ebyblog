I've read some complaints about the <a href="http://www.ready.gov/">Ready.gov</a> site since it came out. <a href="http://www.fas.org/reallyready/index.html">The Federation of American Scientists have released their own version called ReallyReady.org</a> to try to provide better information. They also include an <a href="http://www.fas.org/reallyready/analysis.html">analysis of what's wrong with Ready.gov</a>.
